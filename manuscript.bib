  abstract = {We present a multi-agent ensemble learning approach for supervised learning and evaluate its performance on a task of nonlinear function approximation. This approach relies on a set of learning agents that self-organize according to cooperation rules. We study the properties of this type of system in terms of explainability and interpretability of the prediction process by analyzing the shapes of the agents and their spatial organization. A comparative study on synthetic datasets generated from nonlinear 2D functions is also conducted to evaluate the performance. The results indicate that our multi-agent approach achieves prediction scores similar to state-of-the-art approaches and introduces new properties contributing to address the problematic of explainability in supervised learning.},

  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

This need raises two important questions of (i) an appropriate set of benchmark test problems that the algorithms may be tested upon and (ii) a methodology to compactly and completely present the results. To address the first question, we compiled a collection of test problems, some are better known than others. Although the compilation is not exhaustive, it provides an easily accessible collection of standard test problems for continuous global optimization. Five different stochastic global optimization algorithms have been tested on these problems and a performance profile plot based on the improvement of objective function values is constructed to investigate the macroscopic behavior of the algorithms. The paper also investigates the microscopic behavior of the algorithms through quartile sequential plots, and contrasts the information gained from these two kinds of plots. The effect of the length of run is explored by using three maximum numbers of function evaluations and it is shown to significantly impact the behavior of the algorithms.},

This paper focuses on using traffic light signals to communicate with approaching vehicles. The communication can be traffic-light-signal-to-vehicle (TLS2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V). Based on the information sent, the vehicle receiving the message adapts its speed to a recommended speed (S R ), which helps the vehicle reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The key contribution of this paper is the proposal of a comprehensive optimization model that involves V2V and TLS2V communications. The objective function is to minimize fuel consumption by and emissions from vehicles. The speed that can achieve this goal is the optimum S R (S R *). We also propose efficient heuristic expressions to compute the optimum or near-optimum value of S R .},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The controller is designed to minimize the H{$\infty$} norm of the transfer function from the internal states and the lead vehicle's velocity (disturbance) to the ego vehicle's acceleration to prompt driving smoothness. It implicitly handles position constraints via the minimization of H{$\infty$} norm of the transfer function from the lead vehicle's velocity as a disturbance to the time-headway tracking (performance). The proposed controller is beneficial as it is prediction and optimization-free and hence is lightweight for online implementation. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with a model predictive control (MPC)-based car-following approach, specifically, acceleration minimization, in consideration of electrical and hybrid powertrain operations. Simulation results show that despite its simple linear feedback structure, the H{$\infty$} controller can achieve good performance compared to the MPC controller in the presence of prediction inaccuracy for different types of electrified powertrains.},

We propose a new algorithm called probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (PETS) that combines uncertainty-aware deep network dynamics models with sampling-based uncertainty propagation. Our comparison to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free deep RL algorithms shows that our approach matches the asymptotic performance of model-free algorithms on several challenging benchmark tasks, while requiring significantly fewer samples (e.g., 8 and 125 times fewer samples than Soft Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization respectively on the half-cheetah task).},

  abstract = {Recently, improvements in sensing, communicating, and computing technologies have led to the development of driver-assistance systems (DASs). Such systems aim at helping drivers by either providing a warning to reduce crashes or doing some of the control tasks to relieve a driver from repetitive and boring tasks. Thus, for example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) aims at relieving a driver from manually adjusting his/her speed to maintain a constant speed or a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him/her. Currently, ACC can be improved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where the current speed and acceleration of a vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles by intervehicle communication. This way, vehicle-to-vehicle communication with ACC can be combined in one single system called cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper investigates CACC by proposing a novel approach for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers based on modern machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this paper shows how a reinforcement-learning approach can be used to develop controllers for the secure longitudinal following of a front vehicle. This approach uses function approximation techniques along with gradient-descent learning algorithms as a means of directly modifying a control policy to optimize its performance. The experimental results, through simulation, show that this design approach can result in efficient behavior for CACC.},

  abstract = {Rough pavements cause ride discomfort and energy inefficiency for road vehicles. Existing methods to address these problems are time-consuming and not adaptive to changing driving conditions on rough pavements. With the development of sensor and communication technologies, crowdsourced road and dynamic traffic information become available for enhancing driving performance, particularly addressing the discomfort and inefficiency issues by controlling driving speeds. This study proposes a speed control framework on rough pavements, envisioning the operation of autonomous vehicles based on the crowdsourced data. We suggest the concept of `maximum comfortable speed' for representing the vertical ride comfort of oncoming roads. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed to learn comfortable and energy-efficient speed control strategies. The DRL-based speed control model is trained using real-world rough pavement data in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the vertical ride comfort, energy efficiency, and computation efficiency increase by 8.22\%, 24.37\%, and 94.38\%, respectively, compared to an optimization-based speed control model. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective for real-time speed controls of autonomous vehicles on rough pavements.},

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such ``TreeBoost'' models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

Specifically, smart cars employ hundreds of sensors and electronic systems in order to obtain situational and environmental information. This rapid growth of on-vehicle multi-sensor inputs along with off-vehicle data streams introduce the smart car era. Thus, systematic techniques for combining information provided by on- and off-vehicle car connectivity are of remarkable importance for the availability and robustness of the overall system. This paper presents a new method to employ service oriented agents that cohesively align on- and off-vehicle information in order to estimate the current status of the car. In particular, this work combines, integrates, and evaluates multiple information sources targeting future smart cars. Specifically, the proposed methodology leverages weather-based, on-route, and on-vehicle information. As a use case, the presented work informs the driver about the recommended speed that the car should adapt to, based on the current status of the car. It also validates the proposed speed with real-time vehicular measurements. Keywords: smart cars; environmental information; speed recommendation; points of interest},

As an example, Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) systems warn the driver when the vehicle exceeds the recommended speed limit. However, these systems only take into account fixed speed limits without considering factors like road geometry. In this paper, we consider road curvature with speed limits to automatically adjust vehicle's speed with the ideal one through our proposed Dynamic Speed Adaptation (DSA) method. Furthermore, `curve analysis extraction' and `speed limits database creation' are also part of our contribution. An algorithm that analyzes GPS information off-line identifies high curvature segments and estimates the speed for each curve. The speed limit database contains information about the different speed limit zones for each traveled path. Our DSA senses speed limits and curves of the road using GPS information and ensures smooth speed transitions between current and ideal speeds. Through experimental simulations with different control algorithms on real and simulated datasets, we prove that our method is able to significantly reduce lateral errors on sharp curves, to respect speed limits and consequently increase safety and comfort for the passenger.

However, for their practical diffusion, these systems must adequately take into account the presence of preceding vehicles. In this paper, a safe- and eco-driving control system is proposed for connected and automated vehicles to accelerate or decelerate optimally while guaranteeing vehicle safety constraints. We define minimum intervehicle distance and maximum road speed limit as state constraints, and formulate an optimal control problem minimizing the energy consumption. Then, an analytical state-constrained solution is derived for real-time use. A feasible range of terminal conditions is established, and such conditions are adjusted to guarantee the existence of the analytical solution. The proposed system is evaluated through simulation for various driving scenarios of the preceding vehicle. Results show that it can significantly reduce energy consumption and also avoid collision without increasing trip time. Moreover, the proposed system can serve as an energy-efficient advanced cruise control by setting a short prediction horizon.},

  abstract = {The notion of uncertainty is of major importance in machine learning and constitutes a key element of machine learning methodology. In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.},

  abstract = {Stop-and-go traffic poses significant challenges to the efficiency and safety of traffic operations. In this study, a cooperative longitudinal control based on Soft Actor Critic (SAC) Reinforcement Learning (RL) is proposed to address this issue. The reward function is carefully designed to consider vehicle cooperation and to achieve three main objectives: safety, efficiency, and oscillation dampening. A global performance metric for oscillation dampening is proposed to evaluate the developed RL and other baseline models. Depending on the number of preceding vehicles that can share maneuver information, two models RL-1 and RL-2 are proposed and compared with human driven (HD) and an adaptive cruise control (ACC) model using the HighD and simulated data. It is found that with information from additional preceding vehicles, RL-2 can dampen shockwaves more efficiently. Specifically, RL-1 and RL-2 decrease traffic oscillation by 15\%-36\% and 15\%-42\%, respectively, while HD amplifies the oscillation by 14--37\%. The ACC model can also dampen shockwaves but is not as effective as RL-1 and RL-2. The two RL control methods are further evaluated based on data collected using a commercial Model X vehicle. Compared with the commercial Model X ACC vehicle in some controlled settings, the proposed RL methods can better dampen the stop-and-go waves by generating smaller oscillation growth, overshooting, and average acceleration/deceleration rate change, suggesting that they can generalize well in a new but similar environment. Finally, the RL methods are evaluated considering a platoon of vehicles with different RL penetration rates. The results show that they consistently outperform HD and ACC in dampening shockwaves.},

However, range limitations have substantially hindered the mass adoption of EBs. How to reduce energy consumption is a pressing challenge for bus operations and businesses. This paper develops a whole trip energy-optimal speed control model for connected electric buses passing multiple signalized intersections considering the passenger load, with the help of advanced connected technology. First, the energy consumption related to speed, acceleration and statical features is investigated based on longitudinal dynamics. Then, the energy-optimal speed control model is developed that comprehensively considers passenger load, stop-free passage through multiple signalized intersections and constraints such as travel speed, acceleration, arrival time at stations and intersections. The model is simplified and recast into a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) with high computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments show that the model could reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% compared to the greedy strategy. Sensitive analysis indicates that the model's performance is robust to vehicle mass and forecast error in passenger load.},

Strategies for fuel efficient driving have been studied and experimented with in various conceptual frameworks. This paper presents a novel control system to drive a vehicle efficiently on roads containing varying traffic and signals at intersections for improved fuel economy. The system measures the relevant information of the current road and traffic, predicts the future states of the preceding vehicle, and computes the optimal vehicle control input using model predictive control (MPC). A typical control objective is chosen to maximize fuel economy by regulating a safe head-distance or cruising at the optimal velocity under bounded driving torque condition. The proposed vehicle control system is evaluated in urban traffic containing thousands of diverse vehicles using the microscopic traffic simulator AIMSUN. Simulation results show that the vehicles controlled by the proposed MPC method significantly improve their fuel economy.},

The vehicle route is assumed to be unknown in advance. The properties of the terrain and traffic flow are modeled stochastically. A method is proposed for constructing a control policy off-line to optimally prescribe vehicle speed set-point as a function of current driving conditions, for best on average fuel economy and travel speed performance. A related method is proposed to evaluate expected average fuel economy and travel speed performance of sub-optimal control policies, such as the policies which use constant speed offset relative to average traffic speed. The optimal control law which prescribes vehicle speed set-point can be deployed in advanced vehicle cruise control systems or incorporated into a driver advisory function. In addition, the value function of optimal or suboptimal control policies may be used as a terminal cost in a receding horizon optimization of vehicle speed over routes with known initial segments, or for fuel efficient vehicle routing.},

The optimal control problem of determining the speed profile of the vehicle for minimizing energy consumption is a challenging problem that necessitates the consideration of various aspects, such as the vehicle energy consumption, slope of the road, and driving environment, e.g., the traffic and other vehicles on the road. In this study, an approach using reinforcement learning was applied to the eco-driving problem for electric vehicles considering road slopes. A novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for eco-driving was developed, which separates the vehicle's energy consumption approximation model and driving environment model. Thus, the domain knowledge of vehicle dynamics and the powertrain system is utilized for the reinforcement learning process, while model-free characteristics are maintained by updating the approximation model using experience replay. The proposed algorithm was tested via a vehicle simulation and compared with a solution obtained using dynamic programming (DP), and as well as conventional cruise control driving with constant speed. The simulation results indicated that the speed profile optimized using model-based reinforcement learning had similar behavior to the global solution obtained via DP and energy saving performance compared with cruise control.},

This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.

At the same time, the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) enables agents to learn the optimal strategy in a complex environment by constantly interacting with the environment. In a connected environment with signalized intersections, the optimal control of CAV can significantly reduce fuel consumption and improve driving comfort under the premise of ensuring both traffic efficiency and travel safety. Thus, a DRL-based longitudinal trajectory control approach is proposed to optimize the motion of the CAV in a mixed traffic flow with signalized intersections. By designing a reasonable reward function comprising fuel consumption reward, safety reward, traffic light reward, and travel time reward, the CAV can learn the optimal policy and reach the destination adhering to traffic light and safety. Moreover, the potential-based reward is carefully designed to provide prior knowledge for agents. Eventually, the performances of the CAV with the proposed strategy are testified under different scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed DRL-based optimization method can effectively save fuel consumption of the CAV and the whole platoon, as well as improve driving comfort in all scenarios while satisfying the rules of traffic lights and travel safety.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, in the international scientific community of machine learning, there exists an enormous discussion about the use of black-box models or explainable models; especially in practical problems. On the one hand, a part of the community defends that black-box models are more accurate than explainable models in some contexts, like image preprocessing. On the other hand, there exist another part of the community alleging that explainable models are better than black-box models because they can obtain comparable results and also they can explain these results in a language close to a human expert by using patterns. In this paper, advantages and weaknesses for each approach are shown; taking into account a state-of-the-art review for both approaches, their practical applications, trends, and future challenges. This paper shows that both approaches are suitable for solving practical problems, but experts in machine learning need to understand the input data, the problem to solve, and the best way for showing the output data before applying a machine learning model. Also, we propose some ideas for fusing both, explainable and black-box, approaches to provide better solutions to experts in real-world domains. Additionally, we show one way to measure the effectiveness of the applied machine learning model by using expert opinions jointly with statistical methods. Throughout this paper, we show the impact of using explainable and black-box models on the security and medical applications.},

  abstract = {Eco-drive is one of the many techniques that has been developed to increase vehicle fuel efficiency and improve the sustainability of the entire transportation system. Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) data is now being used to allow vehicles to cooperate better with current and future environments, such as traffic conditions, signal timing, and terrain information. This study proposes an eco-drive algorithm for vehicle fuel consumption optimization on rolling terrains, which frequently causes additional fuel waste due to the inefficient transformation between kinetic and potential energy. The algorithm using the Relaxed Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (RPMP) is computationally efficient and applicable in real time. While similar algorithms have proven effective in simulations with many assumptions, it is necessary to test these algorithms in the field to better understand the algorithm performance and thus make enhancements to optimally control vehicles for eco-drive. Therefore, this study further tested and verified the newly developed algorithms on an innovative CAV platform and quantified the fuel saving benefits of eco-drive. The proposed eco-drive system is compared against conventional constant speed cruise control on a total of 7 road segments over 47 miles. Experimental data shows that more than 20 percent of fuel consumption can be saved. Detailed analysis through linear models also reveal the main geometrical contributors to the eco-drive fuel savings. This finding can provide a rough estimate of the fuel saving potential of given roadways and help state departments of transportation to identify roadways where eco-drive should be implemented. The algorithm and the experiment can also support original equipment manufacturers in developing and marketing this technology to reduce fuel consumption and emissions in the future.},

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of communicating the traffic signal state to the in-vehicle driver assistance systems, on-road experiments were carried out by a number of drivers interacting with an implemented in-vehicle speed advisory application in mixed traffic on arterial roads in the city of San Jose, CA. The experiments show that on average a 9.5\% decrease in fuel usage is possible if accurate SPaT data is available.

We formulate the control problem and provide an analytical, closed-form solution that can be implemented in real time. The solution yields the optimal acceleration/deceleration of each vehicle under the hard safety constraint of rear-end collision avoidance. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated through a microscopic simulation testbed and it is shown that the proposed approach significantly reduces both fuel consumption and travel time. In particular, for three different traffic volume levels, fuel consumption for each vehicle is reduced by 19-22\% compared to the baseline scenario, in which human-driven vehicles are considered, by 12-17\% compared to the variable speed limit algorithm, and by 18-34\% compared to the vehicular-based speed harmonization (SPD-HARM) algorithm. Similarly, travel time is improved by 26-30\% compared to the baseline scenario, by 3-19\% compared to the VSL algorithm, and by 31-39\% compared to the vehicular-based SPD-HARM algorithm.},

For an artificial agent to be considered truly intelligent it needs to excel at a variety of tasks considered challenging for humans. To date, it has only been possible to create individual algorithms able to master a single discipline --- for example, IBM's Deep Blue beat the human world champion at chess but was not able to do anything else. Now a team working at Google's DeepMind subsidiary has developed an artificial agent --- dubbed a deep Q-network --- that learns to play 49 classic Atari 2600 'arcade' games directly from sensory experience, achieving performance on a par with that of an expert human player. By combining reinforcement learning (selecting actions that maximize reward --- in this case the game score) with deep learning (multilayered feature extraction from high-dimensional data --- in this case the pixels), the game-playing agent takes artificial intelligence a step nearer the goal of systems capable of learning a diversity of challenging tasks from scratch. The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

However, so far a generic algorithm that can globally solve the non-linear optimization problem and still implementable in to the current state of computing on board units is not present. In this study, we examine one aspect of the problem by incorporating the effects of road grade to the optimization problem and generate an optimal velocity trajectory for a given road grade profile. We developed simple yet accurate vehicle and fuel consumption models and employed the models as the objective function and state trajectory constraint of the optimization problem. The necessary conditions derived by employing the calculus of variation theory require to separately solve the differential equations with a set of interior point constraints for each road grade interval. As the control became linear to the Hamiltonian function we defined a set of singular arcs and derived the state and optimal control input trajectories along the arcs. We have tested the analytical solution in two example problems and compared the results with a dynamic programming (DP) solution and constant speed cruise operation. The results have shown that the analytical and DP solutions generate very close velocity trajectories which are around 8 -- 10\% more efficient than the constant cruise speed control case for the given examples. Moreover the calculation time of the analytical solution is significantly shorter than the DP solution rendering it possible to real-time on board implementations.},

  abstract = {Driving style, road geometry, and traffic conditions have a significant impact on vehicles' fuel economy. In general, drivers are not aware of the optimal velocity profile for a given route. Indeed, the global optimal velocity trajectory depends on many factors, and its calculation requires intensive computations. In this paper, we discuss the optimization of the speed trajectory to minimize fuel consumption and communicate it to the driver. With this information the driver can adjust his/her speed profile to reduce the overall fuel consumption. We propose to perform the computation-intensive calculations on a distinct computing platform called the ``cloud.'' In our approach, the driver sends the information of the intended travel destination to the cloud. In the cloud, the server generates a route, collects the associated traffic and geographical information, and solves the optimization problem by a spatial domain dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that utilizes accurate vehicle and fuel consumption models to determine the optimal speed trajectory along the route. Then, the server sends the speed trajectory to the vehicle where it is communicated to the driver. We tested the approach on a prototype vehicle equipped with a visual interface mounted on the dash of a test vehicle. The test results show 5\%-15\% improvement in fuel economy depending on the driver and route without a significant effect on the travel time. Although this paper implements the speed advisory system in a conventional vehicle, the solution is generic, and it is applicable to any kind of powertrain structure.},

In the proposed approach the real world road grade profile and speed limits are approximated by a set of piece-wise constant functions and the corresponding first order necessary conditions are derived. By solving a number of differential equations an analytical solution is generated. Therefore, the computation time of the solution is extremely fast. To verify the global optimality of the solution, the results are compared with dynamic programming (DP) solution that solves the complex and non-linear representative model of the actual test vehicle.

  abstract = {The near-miss events involving vulnerable road users can lead to serious accidents. Safe and careful expert drivers perform a hazard-anticipatory driving and they will naturally seek to reduce the uncertainty by attempting to fit their current driving context into a pre-existing category they have already developed, that is, predicting what can happen. In this study, our target situation consists of a cyclist attempting a road crossing at a blind spot. This study aims at developing a context-aware driver model for determining the recommended driving speed at blind intersections based on the analysis of near-miss-incidence database, which includes the data on driver behavior and road environmental factors just before the near-miss. First, we extracted the drive-recorder data using the management tool provided in the database. Second, risk, which is defined as the time margin for drivers to perform evasive actions to avoid a crash, was quantified for the extracted data using the safety-cushion time. The safety-cushion time can be observed as a result of the driver's adjustment to the vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment. One of the key aspects in developing the context-aware driver model is to categorize the extracted near-miss data into two levels based on the risk quantifications: low- and high-risk events. The low- and high-risk events were regarded as a result of the driver's appropriate adjustment of, and inability or failure to adjust the vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment, respectively. Third, based on a multiple linear regression analysis with low-risk event dataset, we constructed a context-aware driver model to produce the recommended vehicle speed depending on the given road environment. The road environment variables, determined by stepwise regression, were identified as factors that reduced or increased the vehicle velocity at blind intersections, and were incorporated into the model as predictors. Furthermore, we quantitatively visualized drivers setting the baseline for speed adjustment and increasing or decreasing the speed according to the given road environment context. Fourth, the model validation demonstrated a coefficient of determination ( {$R$} 2 ) of 0.20, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.54 km/h on average in the 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the constructed driver model on safety performance, we used the dataset of high-risk events as test data. Theoretically, the constructed driver model guided the drivers to drive the vehicle at the recommended speed, and thus convert more than half of the high-risk events into low-risk events. These results indicate that the context-aware driver model is feasible to be used to adjust the approaching speed at blind intersections in accordance with the road environment factors.

  abstract = {Road bumps play a crucial role in enforcing speed limits, thereby preventing overspeeding of vehicles. It significantly contributes to the overall road safety objective through the prevention of accidents that lead to deaths of pedestrians and damage of vehicles. Despite the importance of road bumps, very little research has been done to investigate into their design. While documentation exists on quantitative descriptions of road bumps, they offer little guidance to decision making. This work presents a unique approach to solving road bumps design problems. The results of our study reveal three important road bumps variables that influence the control of vehicle speeds. The key variables are bump height, bump width, and effective distance between two consecutive road bumps. Since vehicle speed control is the ultimate aim of this study the relationship between vehicle speed and other variables earlier mentioned is established. Vehicle speed is defined as the product of frequency at which a vehicle is moving over road bumps and the sum of effective distance between two consecutive road bumps. In the determination of bump height we assume a conical shaped curve for analysis as a matter of research strategy. Based on this, two stages of motion were analysed. The first concerns the motion over the bump itself while the second relates to the motion between two consecutive road bumps. Fourier series was then used to formulate a holistic equation that combines these two stages. We used trigonometric functions to model the behaviour of the first stage while with the second stage giving a functional value of zero since no changes in height are observed. We carried out vibration analysis to determine the effect of road bumps on a vehicular system. Arising from this a model component is referred to as an isolation factor. This offers guidance to the safe frequency at which vehicles could travel over road bumps. The work appears to contribute to knowledge in road bump research through the development of a novel approach to the control of vehicle speeds. Significant research progress could be made if engineering and academic communities at large appreciate our viewpoints. With this work it is apparent that varying of the assumptions made in terms of bump shape may produce high proliferation of beneficial research studies. Although this work may reveal a new way of investigation into road bump research, no claim is made for the work comprehensiveness. We expect experts to challenge some of our thoughts and ideas presented in this work.},

Gaussian process regression is a powerful, non-parametric Bayesian approach towards regression problems that can be utilized in exploration and exploitation scenarios. This tutorial aims to provide an accessible introduction to these techniques. We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration--exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies. Beyond that, we describe a situation modelling risk-averse exploration in which an additional constraint (not to sample below a certain threshold) needs to be accounted for. Lastly, we summarize recent psychological experiments utilizing Gaussian processes. Software and literature pointers are also provided.},

Among the most significant research difficulties in such networks safety is intrusion detection, whose target is to distinguish between misuse and abnormal behavior so as to ensure secure, reliable network operations and services. Intrusion detection is best delivered by multi-agent system technologies and advanced computing techniques. To date, diverse soft computing and machine learning techniques in terms of computational intelligence have been utilized to create Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), yet the literature does not report any state-of-the-art reviews investigating the performance and consequences of such techniques solving wireless environment intrusion recognition issues as they gain entry into cloud computing. The principal contribution of this paper is a review and categorization of existing IDPS schemes in terms of traditional artificial computational intelligence with a multi-agent support. The significance of the techniques and methodologies and their performance and limitations are additionally analyzed in this study, and the limitations are addressed as challenges to obtain a set of requirements for IDPS in establishing a collaborative-based wireless IDPS (Co-WIDPS) architectural design. It amalgamates a fuzzy reinforcement learning knowledge management by creating a far superior technological platform that is far more accurate in detecting attacks. In conclusion, we elaborate on several key future research topics with the potential to accelerate the progress and deployment of computational intelligence based Co-WIDPSs.},

Finding ways to improve decision-making strategies to suit the complex and unfamiliar environments is a standing problem for traditional rule-based methods. This paper proposes a semi-rule-based decision-making strategy for heavy intelligent vehicles based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. Firstly, according to the car-following characteristics, the problems of high dimensions and a large amount of data in vehicle action space and state space are solved by dimension reduction and interval reduction to accelerate the training process. Subsequently, an accurate three-axle vehicle load model is established to calculate the load transfer rate value and carry out active control to increase the roll stability of heavy vehicles at high-speed corners. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is developed based on the reward function and update function to achieve adaptive cruise control objectives for heavy vehicles on different curvature roads. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm are verified through simulation experiments.},

The uncertainty of traffic signal timing for signalized intersections on the road is considered. The eco-driving problem is formulated as a data-driven chance-constrained robust optimization problem. Effective red-light duration (ERD) is defined as a random variable, and describes the feasible passing time through the signalized intersections. Usually, the true probability distribution for ERD is unknown. Consequently, a data-driven approach is adopted to formulate chance constraints based on empirical sample data. This incorporates robustness into the eco-driving control problem with respect to uncertain signal timing. Dynamic programming (DP) is employed to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate optimal speed reference trajectories with 40\% less vehicle fuel consumption, while maintaining the arrival time at a similar level compared to a modified intelligent driver model (IDM). The proposed control approach significantly improves the controller's robustness in the face of uncertain signal timing, without requiring to know the distribution of the random variable a priori.},

  abstract = {Fog is a weather condition that reduces visibility of the driving scene, while slow traffic may be formed due to the bottleneck on freeways. This phenomenon may lead to higher rear-end crash risk when vehicles approach slow traffic, since drivers might not observe the speed reduction ahead of them timely with the reduced visibility and could not have enough time to respond. This study aims to develop a variable speed limit (VSL) control strategy to reduce the rear-end crash risk at freeway bottlenecks under fog conditions. A VSL control algorithm was developed with consideration of the different relationships between the gap and visibility distance. The VSL strategy was also tested in the fully connected vehicles (CV) environment. A feedback control framework was developed to combine the VSL and CV control. The proposed VSL strategy was implemented and tested for a freeway section with a bottleneck through the micro-simulation software VISSIM and the intelligent driver model (IDM) was employed to account for car following in the CV environment. Finally, two measurements, which include time-to-collision at braking (TTCbrake) and total travel time (TTT), were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The results demonstrated that the VSL control played an important role in reducing rear-end crash risk and the effects of the VSL control could be affected by compliance rates. In addition, it was found that the CV environment could further enhance the safety benefits of VSL control and improve the traffic efficiency.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a robust optimal speed control approach based on hierarchical architecture for AEV through combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robust control. In decision-making layer, a deep maximum entropy proximal policy optimization (DMEPPO) algorithm is presented to obtain an optimal speed via dynamic environment information, heuristic target entropy and adaptive entropy constraint. In motion control layer, to track the learned optimal speed while resisting uncertainty and disturbance, a robust speed controller is designed by the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, simulation experiment results show that the proposed robust optimal speed control scheme based on hierarchical architecture for AEV is feasible and effective.},

  abstract = {Autonomous driving technology, a catalyst for revolutionizing transportation and urban mobility, has the tend to transition from rule-based systems to data-driven strategies. Traditional module-based systems are constrained by cumulative errors among cascaded modules and inflexible pre-set rules. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving systems have the potential to avoid error accumulation due to their fully data-driven training process, although they often lack transparency due to their ``black box" nature, complicating the validation and traceability of decisions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated abilities including understanding context, logical reasoning, and generating answers. A natural thought is to utilize these abilities to empower autonomous driving. By combining LLM with foundation vision models, it could open the door to open-world understanding, reasoning, and few-shot learning, which current autonomous driving systems are lacking.

Automatic decision-making approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), have been applied to control the vehicle speed. However, the popular Q-learning algorithm is unstable in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach called Double Q-learning is used to control a vehicle's speed based on the environment constructed by naturalistic driving data. Depending on the concept of the direct perception approach, we propose a new method called integrated perception approach to construct the environment. The input of the model is made up of high dimensional data including road information processed from the video data and the low dimensional data processed from the sensors. During experiment, compared with deep Q-learning algorithm, double deep Q-learning has improvements both in terms of value accuracy and policy quality. Our model's score is 271.73\% times that of deep Q-learning.},

  abstract = {Since a tunnel is dark and driving conditions are monotonous, drivers are prone to optical illusions, affecting driving safety in tunnels. Tunnel sidewall decorations can provide visual stimulation to prevent or reduce traffic crashes. Driving simulation experiments with a driving simulator and speed perception experiments with E-Prime software are performed to evaluate the influence of tunnel sidewall murals on the speed control of drivers in a long tunnel. Three mural designs (A2: 1.93 Hz, A3: 1.27 Hz, A4: 0.95 Hz) with different frequencies and a control group (no mural, A1) are evaluated. Four indicators of the driver's speed control (speed, acceleration, stimulation of subjectively equal speed (SSES), and reaction time) are selected. The results show that the driver's speed is significantly reduced in the middle of the tunnel and near the tunnel exit, and the driver's speed control is significantly enhanced by the murals. It is recommended to install murals in the middle and near the exit of the tunnel for optimal speed control. The SSES shows that tunnel murals affect drivers' speed perception and alertness. As the frequency of the mural decreases, speed overestimation changes to underestimation, the degree of speed illusion increases, and the reaction time decreases. A difference is observed between the perceived and actual speed, and this difference depends on the mural's frequency. Thus, choosing an appropriate mural frequency improves the mural's effect. The results provide a basis for mural design on the sidewalls of long tunnels to improve tunnel safety, as well as a novel approach for speed reduction.

First, a link based dynamic network loading model is developed to simulate the traffic flow propagation allowing the change of speed limits. Shockwave propagation is well defined and captured by checking the difference between the queue forming end and the dissipation end. Second, the dynamic speed limit problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solved by a real time control mechanism. The speed limit controller is modeled as an intelligent agent interacting with the stochastic network environment stochastic network environment to assign time dependent link based speed limits. Based on different metrics, e.g. total network throughput, delay time, vehicular emissions are optimized in the modeling framework, the optimal speed limit scheme is obtained by applying the R-Markov Average Reward Technique (R-MART) based reinforcement learning algorithm. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is constructed to test the performance of the model. Results show that the total travel time and emissions (in terms of CO) are reduced by around 18\% and 20\% compared with the base case of non-speed limit control.},

  abstract = {Most popular optimizers for deep learning can be broadly categorized as adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum). For many models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), adaptive methods typically converge faster but generalize worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adaptive methods are typically the default because of their stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the "belief" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

  abstract = {This study proposes a framework for human-like autonomous car-following planning based on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Historical driving data are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial and error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the agent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed, relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. As shown by this study's results, a deep deterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between simulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction delay of 1\,s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car-following behavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation error of 18\% and speed validation error of 5\%, which are less than those of other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally weighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover, the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving situations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight into driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like autonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.},
