This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature on speed recommendation systems.
 We decompose the problem into two sub-problems:
 a 
\emph on
modeling problem
\emph default
,
 which involves continuously estimating vehicle dynamics under driver-specific influence to enable personalized and realistic speed recommendations;
 and a 
\emph on
control problem
\emph default
,
 which leverages the learned model to optimize speed profiles with respect to predefined objectives and operational constraints.
 To establish a rigorous foundation and position our approach within the field,
 we examine state-of-the-art methods across three relevant domains:
 speed control and recommendation,
 online machine learning,
 and optimal control.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve speed recommendation we need to model the behavior of a vehicle driven by a human driver in response to speed recommendation set points.
 Thus,
 we need a modeling algorithm able to perform online learning and learn efficiently seeing a data point once while having transparent and explainable inner workings.
 For that reason we explored the use of multiagent systems as a mean of solving supervised learning tasks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As showed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

,
 a supervised learning problem can be modeled as a multiagent system.
 This perspective offers several advantages,
 including design simplicity,
 transparency,
 and explainability properties that naturally emerge from the spatial organization of agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we introduce CELL (Context Ensemble Local Learning),
 a family of multiagent systems designed for online learning dynamics of a complex environment.
 Our approach addresses online supervised learning through simple self-organization of multiple local expert agents paving the feature space.
 These agents are created and updated dynamically according to predefined learning rules.
 Each agent occupies a specific region in feature space,
 representing the area where it is most confident in the quality of its predictions.
 Contrary to previous works on this type of system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

,
 we introduce novelties regarding the explainability while exploring new cooperation mechanisms between agents and new spatialization approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By leveraging the spatialization of local experts and the inherent transparency of the model,
 we derive unique informative explainability properties that provide valuable insights about the approximated function.
 Furthermore,
 we outline practical guidelines for scaling with the number of agents,
 keeping a bounded computational complexity.

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Agent Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-agent systems (MAS) have gained popularity due to their ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems that can be easily addressed by autonomous agents,
 whether interconnected or not 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dorri2018multi"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The interaction rules between agents or with the environment are defined by the system designer to achieve a specific objective.
 The use of MAS has proven effective in fields such as civil engineering 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 or electrical engineering,
 particularly with issues related to smart grids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In more recent years,
 reinforcement learning has been seriously considered to bypass the phase of designing rules that define agent behavior.
 Indeed,
 in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL),
 agents' behaviors are learned using reinforcement signals obtained by continuously interacting with an environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter,
 we present various iterations of CELL,
 a MAS that combines both approaches to tackle online supervised learning problems.
 Agents of the system update using both reinforcement learning signals and cooperation rules.
 Unlike MARL,
 our approach requires fewer environment interactions and focuses on specialized agents collaborating within a supervised learning framework,
 differing from MARL's dynamic interactions aiming to maximize cumulative rewards through adaptive strategies (
\emph on
competitive
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
cooperative
\emph default
)

Ensemble Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve more accurate predictions and provide better approximations of nonlinear functions,
 it is common to aggregate multiple models for making predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensemble learning is based on the emergence of collective intelligence within a set of weak learners.
 A weak learner is a model whose performance is at least as good as a model making random predictions.
 During the learning process,
 a set of models (which may differ from one another) are trained in parallel or sequentially 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "polikarEnsembleLearning2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The objective is to encourage diversity among the models so that they do not all capture the same patterns in the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dietterichEnsembleMethodsMachine2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 An input is transmitted to all weak learners,
 each of which makes a prediction proposal.
 A heuristic is implemented to select one of the proposals or to weight each of them in order to construct the final prediction.
 We distinguish several major approaches in ensemble learning which are Boosting,
 Bagging and Stacking.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Bagging we train multiple models (usually homogeneous) in parallel on different subsets of the training data to introduce diversity,
 reduce variance and improve stability.
 Then the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of the weak learners (regression) or by majority voting (classification).
 Unlike Bagging,
 in Boosting,
 we train the models sequentially.
 Each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones to reduce bias and improve accuracy.
 Then we obtain the final prediction from a weighted average of the predictions of the all the weak learners.
 Finally,
 we have Stacking that falls under meta-learning.
 We train in parallel a set of heterogeneous models and then we train a meta-model whose role will be to combine the predictions of each model to obtain the final output of the system,
 in order to capture complementary strengths of each learning algorithms involved in the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The family of systems we present in this chapter,
 CELL,
 falls within the ensemble learning framework and we could label it as a Bagging approach because we consider a set of weak learners as a collection of self-organizing cooperative agents.
 Each one of them is a local expert on the function to be approximated.

\begin_layout Standard
The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses the opacity of complex models by providing insights into their decision-making processes.
 However,
 interpretability and explainability are defined in various ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gilpin2018explaining,doshi2017towards"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and often used interchangeably.
 Thus,
 following the distinction made in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "burkart2021survey"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 we differentiate between interpretability and explainability.
 Interpretability is defined as the inherent ability to understand how the model works as a whole,
 focusing on the model's structure and mechanisms (i.e transparency).
 In contrast,
 explainability is associated with the methodologies used to communicate the reasoning for a specific decision taken by a model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Approaches such as deep learning achieve good performance across a wide variety of tasks.
 However,
 these approaches generate highly complex models.
 There must be a compromise between the model's performance and its ability to produce explainable predictions and interpretable structures

Within this discourse,
 machine learning models are typically categorized as white-box or black-box models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "loyola-gonzalezBlackBoxVsWhiteBox2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Black-box models have opaque and complex inner workings that are difficult for an external observer to understand.
 This categorisation includes deep learning models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lecunDeepLearning2015"

\end_inset

 and some ensemble models

\end_inset

.
 Conversely,
 white-box models have simpler and less opaque inner workings.
 These models,
 considered more explainable than black-box models,
 include linear regression models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,
 decision trees 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 ,
 and other rule-based approaches.
 To achieve explainability,
 white-box models are preferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The explainability of a prediction is partly linked to the concept of uncertainty.
 An informed decision-making process must take uncertainty into account.
 We distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chuaDeepReinforcementLearning2018,hullermeierAleatoricEpistemicUncertainty2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Aleatoric uncertainty arises from the inherent natural variation in the studied phenomena.
 It may be due to random fluctuations,
 measurement errors,
 or other unpredictable factors.
 Epistemic uncertainty on the other hands,
 stems from a lack of knowledge or complete understanding of the studied phenomenon.
 This type of uncertainty is related to the lack of data in certain regions of the feature space.

oCELL:
 Multiagent Ensemble Learning with Orthotopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section introduces the first variant of CELL,
 referred to as oCELL (orthotope CELL).
 CELL systems are multiagent systems composed of autonomous agents,
 each possessing local knowledge and specific capabilities.
 These systems build upon the Self-Adaptive Context Learning (SACL) paradigm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "boesSelfAdaptiveContextLearning2015"

 to address online supervised learning tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective is to approximate a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 that maps feature vectors to target vectors from a continuous stream of data.
 oCELL processes incoming data points by routing them to its primary components,
 the context agents.
 These agents are dynamically created and updated according to predefined learning rules.
 Each agent occupies a distinct region of the feature space defined as an orthotope,
 where it maintains the highest confidence in its predictions.
 This spatial organization allows agents to determine 
\emph on
when
\emph default
 they should contribute to the prediction process.
 To determine 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 to predict,
 each agent maintains a local machine learning model over to its confidence region.

\begin_layout Subsection
Context Agents
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Context-Agents"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main entities of oCELL are context agents.
 A context agent,
 denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}_{i}=\left\{ \phi_{i},f_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

is defined by two core components:
 an activation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and a prediction function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The activation function determines whether the agent should contribute to the prediction for a given input 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 while the prediction function provides the corresponding output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each agent can adapt the parameters of its activation and prediction functions based on reinforcement signals derived from its performance,
 enabling it to refine its behavior according to local conditions in feature space.
 Conceptually,
 a context agent acts as a local expert for the target function with activation function governing 
\emph on
when
\emph default
 the agent predicts,
 and the prediction function specifying 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 it predicts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first describe the spatialization mechanism of context agents based on orthotopes.
 Then we detail the prediction mechanisms arising from interactions within an agent’s neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Spatialization with Orthotopes
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Spatialization-with-Orthotopes"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure transparency and interpretability,
 oCELL spatialize context agents using orthotopes (also referred to as hyper-rectangles in the literature).
 Orthotopes provide a clear geometric representation of an agent's confidence region in the feature space,
 allowing precise evaluation of agent organization and facilitating shape adaptation during self-organization.
 This representation allows independent manipulation of each feature dimension,
 simplifying expansion and retraction operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning with orthotopes has been explored in previous works on supervised learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fourezEnsembleMultiAgentSystem2022,konstantinov2023interpretable"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These approaches typically partition the feature space into orthotopes and model the target function locally.
 For instance,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "konstantinov2023interpretable"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 employs a gradient boosting to learn orthotope bounds,
 where each region corresponds to a simple constant model.
 However this approach is not suitable for online learning from data streams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
oCELL borrows a similar spatialization principle to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,
 which uses the SACL paradigm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "boesSelfAdaptiveContextLearning2015"

\end_inset

 to progressively pave the feature space with context agents to address classification tasks.
 However,
 unlike 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

,
 oCELL addresses issues specifically related to regression tasks such as the need for a smoother spatialization of agents to smooth prediction accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each agent's activation function defines a 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-dimensional orthotope in the feature space.
 For each feature dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in\left\{ 1,\dots,n\right\} $
\end_inset

,
 the orthotope is parameterized by a lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}$
\end_inset

 and an upper bound 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{j}$
\end_inset

 such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

The volume 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(\mathcal{A}_{i}\right)$

\begin_layout Standard
Agents in oCELL are constructed based on the assumption of uniform knowledge over their confidence region,
 i.e the area delimited by the associated orthotope.
 We distinguish between activation and neighborhood.
 When an agent is activated by a point,
 it means it is confident in its expertise to predict for that point.
 When an agent is a neighbor of a point,
 it means it has doubts about its expertise to predict for that point.
 In other words,
 it's an agent that is a candidate to become an activated agent for that point.
 The way an agent updates itself differs depending on whether the agent is activated or a neighbor.

 which minimizes overlap to avoid ambiguity in classification (for example agents could push each other),
 oCELL allows overlapping regions to allow prediction smoothing through ensemble averaging.
 This property is particularly useful for regression tasks as it can be more informative to average the predictions of several weak models to smooth the learned function.
 It also facilitates integration into non-linear optimization processes (cf.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
h_{j}^{t+1} & =\begin{cases}
\left(h_{j}^{t}-l_{j}^{t}\right)\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{k}}+l_{j}^{t} & \text{if }l_{j}^{t}\leq x_{j}\leq h_{j}^{t}\\
h_{j}^{t} & \text{else}
\end{cases}\\
l_{j}^{t+1} & =\begin{cases}
\left(l_{j}^{t}-h_{j}^{t}\right)\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{k}}+h_{j}^{t} & \text{if }l_{j}^{t}\leq x_{j}\leq h_{j}^{t}\\
l_{j}^{t} & \text{else}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\begin{cases}
\left(1+\alpha\right) & \text{if expansion}\\
\left(1-\alpha\right) & \text{if retraction}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the number of features such that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}^{t}\leq x_{j}\leq h_{j}^{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 the new volume of the orthotope associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is given by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 agents are spatialized through activation functions defining orthotopes that represent their 
\emph on
confidence region
\emph default
 (i.e area of expertise) in feature space.
 Each agent can adapt its bounds,
 expanding or contracting its associated orthotope as needed.
 Intuitively,
 larger agents act as 
\emph on
generalists
\emph default
,
 while smaller agents serve as 
\emph on
specialists
\emph default
.
 Consequently,
 complex regions of feature space tend to host many small agents,
 whereas simpler regions tend to be covered by fewer larger agents.
 This assumption aligns with the use of simple local models such as linear regressions,
 which we use in subsequent experiments for the transparency and interpretability of their inner workings.

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of oCELL is to perform online regression from a continuous data stream.
 Spcifically,
 it aims at modeling the nonlinear dynamics of a complex system for subsequent use in an optimization pipeline for optimal control (see Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "chap:Solving-Control-Tasks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Thus,
 it's desirable to minimize gradient noise and ensure the learned function is smooth,
 as irregularities can significantly disrupt the optimization process

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this,
 oCELL allows multiple agents to contribute to the final prediction,
 in contrast to previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "boesSelfAdaptiveContextLearning2015,dato2021apprentissage,fourezEnsembleMultiAgentSystem2022"

\end_inset

,
 where a single agent was ultimately selected for prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 from an observation 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 we first need to select the agents that are the most competent to predict the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

.
 If some agents are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 then they make proposals,
 instead,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 has no neighbor,
 we select the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-closest agents instead.
 This fallback mechanism prevents prediction failures in regions where the system has limited knowledge (i.e poor paving of the area around 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 The final prediction is then given by the arithmetic mean of the proposals of selected agents such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{y}=\frac{1}{\left|D_{\text{selected}}\right|}\times\sum_{i\in D_{\text{selected}}}f_{i}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\text{selected}}$
\end_inset

is the set of selected agents (neighbors or closest) and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 the internal prediction function of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th agent.

Learning Rules
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Learning-Rules"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL systems,
 the design of learning rules revolves around a set of actions and trigger conditions that decide how to digest the continuous stream of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{new},y_{new}\right)$
\end_inset

 data.
 Some actions are tied to individual agents such as updating their model (prediction function) or shape (activation function);
 and others are more meta-level actions such as destroying or creating new agents.
 These actions are triggered by conditions.
 In oCELL,
 those conditions depend on the number of current neighbors,
 on the number of activated agents and on a feedback value calculated from the proposals of selected agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the appropriate action for an agent,
 we define the prediction quality 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}=g\left(\hat{y},y\right)
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{m}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a distance measure between the proposal 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 and the true value 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The largest 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
 the worse the quality of the proposal.
 In oCELL,
 we use the squared error as the 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 function but other types of error functions could be used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define two thresholds 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{good}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{bad}}$
\end_inset

 to partition the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 into three regimes:
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 predictions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 predictions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{bad}},+\infty\right[$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
bad
\emph default
 predictions.
 These thresholds control the degree of accuracy expected from the system and influence the frequency of some rule activation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inaccuracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}\geq1$
\end_inset

 activated agents for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 it means the region around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 is already known because it is covered by agents.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 it means the prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 and it was right to declare itself as an expert on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 will therefore seek to generalize in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 by extending its area of expertise.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 then the prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 but not catastrophic,
 so it only refines its internal model and keeps its positions waiting for another signal to expand if needed.
 Then,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{bad}},+\infty\right[$
\end_inset

,
 the prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
bad,

\emph default
 meaning that it shouldn't have been activated.
 In reaction to that,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

will retract to get away from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 This rule is the core of agents local self-organization.
 It allows the agents to move in feature space and refine their model as needed to exclude or include points to better model their close surroundings in response to feedbacks on the quality of their predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Incompetence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}=0$
\end_inset

 activated agents and 
\begin_inset Formula $N\geq1$
\end_inset

 agents that are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 all of the closest agents are candidate on becoming activated on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 In this situation,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]\cup\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 i.e prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
,
 then it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 could become an expert on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 so it refines its model and expands towards 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 Otherwise,
 if no neighbor gives 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 predictions,
 then we create a new agent centered on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 This rule promotes knowledge reuse and limit redundant agent creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Uselessness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice,
 we observe a need for agent destruction mechanisms within the system.
 Indeed,
 some agents may evolve into degenerate shapes if they receive too much negative feedbacks in a row.
 They become far too small to be informative.
 These 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
 agents most probably won't be activated ever again and are no longer useful in the system.
 Consequently,
 all agents whose volume falls below a certain threshold value 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{vol}}$
\end_inset

 are destroyed.

Therefore,
 oCELL relies on several hyperparameters that must be initialized prior to training.
 These parameters have an influence on the convergence of the system.
 These parameters include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial orthotope size (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

):
 determines the initial confidence region of newly created agents;
 overly small regions may hinder proper activation and make new agents overspecialize locally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prediction thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{bad}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{good}}$
\end_inset

):
 define accuracy regimes and influence rule activation frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Volume variation coefficient (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

):
 controls the rate of expansion or retraction of agents as a fraction of their current volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Destruction threshold (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{vol}}$
\end_inset

):
 specifies the minimum volume below which an agent is considered as a candidate for destruction.

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the performances of oCELL,
 we conduct a comparative study against standard machine learning algorithms on a regression task.
 This section outlines the experimental protocol and compare performances against various metrics.
 For this experiment,
 each context agent employs a linear regression as its internal model.
 This choice is motivated by the simplicity and transparency of the inner workings of linear transformations.
 This aligns with the design of oCELL and facilitate clear analysis of the system's behavior.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment is conducted on four two-dimensional benchmark functions commonly used in optimization research.
 These functions were selected due to their nonlinear characteristics and the challenges they present for optimization,
 particularly for gradient-based methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jamil2013ALS"

\end_inset

.
 This choice is motivated by the fact that state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

literal "false"

\end_inset

 partially rely on gradient-based optimization during the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure relevance of the evaluation while keeping it low-dimensional,
 we selected classical functions known for their optimization difficulty,
 characterized by multiple local optima and nonlinear variations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "aliNumericalEvaluationSeveral2005,Jamil2013ALS"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The functions considered are the SSR functions (
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)=\sin\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right)$
\end_inset

),
 Booth,
 Goldstein-Price,
 and Beale functions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 For each function,
 a synthetic dataset comprising 8000 observations was generated by uniformly sampling points within the feature space.

 oCELL achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and the highest coefficient of determination (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

) for all four functions.
 It also attains the best mean squared error (MSE) on the SSR,
 Goldstein-Price,
 and Booth functions,
 while XGBoost performs slightly better in terms of MSE on the Beale function.
 Overall,
 oCELL demonstrates comparable performances to XGBoost and LightGBM for most functions,
 while consistently outperforming the weak learners.
 These results indicate that oCELL effectively captures the nonlinear variations of the underlying functions from the data,
 as illustrated in

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach is similar to LIME since it involves learning local surrogate models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 However,
 oCELL introduces additional properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the internal model of agents are white-box models like linear regressions,
 then we can consider oCELL as a fully interpretable white box model.
 Indeed,
 the final prediction is obtained by linear combination of the individual predictions of a restricted set of agents,
 unlike classical bagging or boosting ensemble models in which all models can contribute (which can blur the credit assigment between a large number of weak-learners).
 This property makes oCELL interpretable according to the definition introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore it's possible to analyze and interpret the internal structures of the model,
 such as the spatial organization of agents to extract information about the underlying function to the data.
 For didactic purposes,
 the remainder of this section is based on a training carried out on a synthetic dataset generated from the Beale function (cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Heatmaps"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 This nonlinear function exhibits regimes of amplitude variations that are very different across its domain of definition.
 The amplitude of the gradients of the Beale function varies greatly at the boundaries of the definition domain (
\begin_inset Formula $-4\leq x,y\leq4$
\end_inset

),
 while in the central plateau,
 the variations in gradient amplitude are more subtle.
 The Beale function is frequently used as a benchmark for testing optimization algorithms

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Uncertainty and Confidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of neighborhood and more broadly the spatial organization of agents allows to extract various metrics of the local organization of agents in the feature space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Epistemic Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During training,
 the agents organize themselves in the feature space.
 Depending on the training dataset and the complexity of the underlying function,
 the results of self-organization varies.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Visualization-tiling-beale"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 gaps (uncovered zones) in the agent tiling may remain.
 It is possible that for a given observation,
 no 
\emph on
Context
\emph default
 agent is activated.
 In such cases,
 making a prediction requires relying on the proposals of the nearest agents in the observation's neighborhood.
 To determine if the agents' prediction is reliable,
 we define the coverage index 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 of the observation's neighborhood as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{\text{coverage}}=\frac{V_{\text{agents}}}{V_{\text{neighborhood}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\text{agents}}$
\end_inset

 is the volume covered by the 
\emph on
Context
\emph default
 agents in the neighborhood and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\text{neighborhood}}$
\end_inset

 is the volume of the hyperrectangle representing the neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

,
 then the space around the observation contains few gaps:
 our model is proficient in that region of space.
 Therefore,
 it is relevant to consider the predictions of nearby agents.
 Conversely,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

,
 then the space around the observation contains many gaps.
 There is a high probability that this region of space was underexplored during training.
 This may indicate either gaps in the training data specific to that area of space,
 or that training did not proceed as expected for various reasons (strong non-linearities in the function to approximate,
 presence of noise,
 discontinuity,
 etc...).
 We illustrate the utility of the coverage index in a scenario where our system learns from a dataset with an entire portion of missing data 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Comparison-coverage-index"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 We observe that the coverage index helps identify the missing portion of data in the training dataset without having directly access to the actual training dataset.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covergae index is therefore a quantitative measure of the epistemic uncertainty associated with a prediction.
 it provides a direct assessment of the model's learned boundaries and limitations in various regions of the feature space.
 For the development of critical systems,
 this property is essential to observe in order to assess the risk of extrapolation or interpolation errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This measure is fundamentally linked to both explainability and interpretability.
 Locally,
 at the individual prediction level,
 coverage index serves as a crucial component of post-hoc explanation.
 By quantifying the reliability of the output,
 it effectively represents a degree of trustworhtiness and the necessity of relying on neighborhood averaging (cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsubsec:Neighborhood-Prediction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Globally,
 the aggregated coverage index allows for the systematic analysis and visualization of the entire agent organization across the feature space.
 This analysis of the overall tiling pattern directly addresses interpretability by giving tools for understanding the model's inherent structure and mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Aleatoric Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After training,
 when an observation is provided to the model,
 each activated agent makes a prediction proposal.
 We can thus calculate the discrepancy between the prediction proposals from the set of proposals of the activated agents (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}$
\end_inset

) to deduce a measure of aleatoric uncertainty:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{activated}}=\sqrt{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}}\frac{\left|p-p_{\text{mean}}\right|}{n_{\text{activated}}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{mean}}$
\end_inset

 is the average of the proposals in the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{\text{activated}}$
\end_inset

 is the number of activated agents.
 This value estimates the disagreement among agents which judge themselves as equally competent to propose a prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This value of discrepancy quantifies the aleatoric uncertainty associated with the model's predictions.
 It captures the inherent noise and stochasticity as a disagreement among locally activated agents.
 It's linked to explainability because it primarily relates to locality at the prediction-level,
 providing useful tools to explain predictions under the angle of trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then,
 as oCELL is agnostic of the internal model of the agents that compose it,
 it's possible to use a class of models capable of inherently providing a measure of uncertainty on predictions,
 such as Gaussian Processes.
 Those are models which allow estimation of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "schulzTutorialGaussianProcess2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Exploiting the strength of this type of model could make the estimation of aleatoric uncertainty more robust.
 The major drawback of this approach is the computational and space complexities of Gaussian Processes which can significantly slow down the learning process.

Limitations
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Limitations"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We demonstrated the potential of oCELL to solve supervised learning problems.
 However,
 this approach still needs refinement and has limitations that we will address in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:kCELL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the limitations of this approach lies in the neighborhood prediction system described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:kCELL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed we assumed in designing our system that an agent's level of knowledge about the function to be approximated is uniform across its area of expertise (i.e the orthotope associated to its activation function).
 Intuitively it might be more accurate to consider that an agent has a better expertise near its centroid,
 than on its edges.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 we also consider,
 when mutliple agents are involved in the prediction process that they have the same weight in the construction of the final prediction due to the arithmetic sum.
 Initially,
 we decided to proceed this way because of the knowledge uniformity assumption.
 However it would probably be more accurate to consider that when two agent make predictions,
 the one closest to the input point will has the smallest error due to the agent's spatial distribution.
 Thus,
 each agent involved in the prediction process should be weighted according to their level of expertise on the point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With oCELL,
 we attempted to calculate a weighted average of the agents' proposals to obtain the final prediction.
 The weights corresponded to the euclidean distance to centers of the agents involved.
 However,
 we found that this did not improve performances,
 likely because the euclidean distance to the centers do not account for the agent's shape.
 We therefore need to find a distance between an agent and the point that takes into account both the agent's centroid and its shape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another limitation lies in the spatialization of agents using orthotopes.
 Indeed,
 in some cases,
 the orthotopic representation may be limited and may not correspond to the reality of the points on which the agent learns.
 This can lead to covering entire areas that have never been seen,
 thus potentially generating false positives when we query the system about its knowledge of a point.
 We illustrate this in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Limitation orthotope agents"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 in which we compare side by side an overgeneralizing agent and a representative agent by visualizing their respective orthotopes (represented by a blue rectangle) and training data (represented by red dots).
 The overgeneralizing agent has its training data not covering the entirety of its associated orthotope unlike for the representative agent that seemingly has a training dataset that covers entirely it's associated orthotope.
 This example shows how crucial is the spatialization of agents and especially their base shape to best represent the local manifolds of features,
 avoid overgeneralization errors and avoid categorizing a point as known when it's not.

oCELL has been designed for online machine learning.
 However,
 it does not exploit the relationships between successive points in a data stream.
 It considers each point to be independent,
 effectively limiting oCELL's convergence speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the last limitation we were able to identify that some hyperparameters are difficult to tune.
 We are referring in particular to the initial size of the orthotopes associated with the new created agents,
 which requires setting a side length for each feature.
 In addition to being difficult to tune,
 this parameter has the most significant impact on the final performance of the system compared to others.
 In this regard,
 we can also refer to the error thresholds used to categorize a prediction as 
\emph on
good
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
bad
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inaccurate

kCELL:

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have extended Context agent learning to address regression tasks in the context of supervised learning.
 We showed that oCELL has competitive performances on a synthetic 2D benchmark dataset and exhibits interesting explainability properties.
 Indeed,
 we showed that we could extract measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the predictions of the system as well as information about the variations of the underlying function from the shape and spatial organization of the 
\emph on
Context
\emph default
 agents in the feature space.
 These properties will be particularly useful when using this type of model in an optimization loop for safe optimal control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 oCELL has some limitations.
 Specifically,
 the spatialization of agents with orthotopes can sometimes produce erroneous representations of areas of expertise,
 leading to overestimations of their size and shape.
 In addition to that,
 the aggregation function used to compute predictions do not account for the shape and distance between the agents involved and the input.
 These limitations can sometimes lead to in-distribution interpolation problems and redundant agents.
 Furthermore,
 oCELL consider all points as independent and thus do not exploit the relationships between successive points,
 limiting its convergence speed in an online setting in which adaptativity is fairly important.
 Finally,
 some of oCELL's learning rules rely on hyperparameters that are difficult to tune (error thresholds and initial size of orthotope sides at agent creation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To overcome these limitations,
 we introduce kCELL (kernel CELL),
 the second variant of CELL.
 In order to better represent the information we propose a spatialization approach based on RBF kernels inspired from what is done with RBF Networks

 We also introduce a smoother aggregation function for inference to better represent the expertise of each agent involved in the prediction process taking inspiration from what is done for Gaussian Processes

\begin_inset Note Comment

\end_inset

,
 the main entities of kCELL are the Context agents.
 A Context agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is characterized by an activation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and a prediction function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}_{i}=\left\{ \phi_{i},f_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 unlike in oCELL,
 the Context agents of kCELL are spatialized differently.
 In oCELL we use a binary activation (the point is inside or outside the associated orthotope) while in kCELL we use a RBF kernel as a continuous and smooth activation function to represent the area of expertise in feature space.

.
 This activation function is smooth and differentiable,
 making the system more optimization-friendly to be used for control tasks as a dynamics model.
 Therefore,
 an agent is spatialized by the mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$
\end_inset

 of the distribution of its training points.
 Since this activation function has statistical significance,
 it is easier for us to define the neighborhood as a confidence interval whose confidence value we can adjust.

,
 an explainability metric that we derived from oCELL which is also linked to the degree of knowledge of a point.
 In kCELL,
 this explainability property related to the knowledge of a point emerges naturally from the definition of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
With kCELL we want to retain as few points as possible in memory to truly represent information through local models.
 As previously stated,
 the spatialization of each agent can be fully described by a mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$

 and a covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$

 Each time a point is ingested by agent

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

 is the number of points ingested by the agent to update its shape.

Soft-Weighted Prediction

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In kCELL,
 we get rid of the knowledge uniformity hypothesis of agents to better represent the knowledge of the system.
 Therefore the activation function of a context agent materializes its area of expertise through a smooth RBF kernel.
 The further a point is from the agent's centroid,
 the lower its activation value.
 This is because we assume that expertise is maximized at the agent's center.
 Agents with higher activation values contribute more heavily to the final output because they are more expert than others at predicting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}=\left\{ i|\mathcal{A}_{i}\,\text{is in the \ensuremath{k}-closest to}\,x\right\} $
\end_inset

 denote the index set of the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 nearest agents in feature space.
 The final prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 of the system is then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)=\sum_{i\in S_{k}}w_{i}\left(x\right)f_{i}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

where the normalized contribution weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 are defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{i}\left(x\right)=\frac{\phi_{i}\left(x\right)}{\sum_{j\in S_{k}}\phi_{j}\left(x\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This formulation ensures that each contributing agent's influence on the final prediction is proportional to its estimated competence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Learning Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in oCELL,
 we design our learning rules around a set of actions and conditions that triggers those actions to digest 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new},y_{new}$
\end_inset

 that are fed to the system sequentially as a data stream.
 In context agent learning systems,
 the set of actions consists of the actions that can be performed individually by agents such as updating their model or shape;
 and more meta-level actions such as destroying or creating new agents.
 These actions are triggered by conditions that generally depend on two factors:
 the number of current neighbors and a feedback value calculated from the proposals of selected agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

 agents that are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 all of those agents are theoretically considered as experts to predict for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 As the final prediction fo the system 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 is computed from the proposals of all those agents,
 we need the agents to cooperate together locally to improve the local knowledge.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
 the fractional change in error when leaving agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 out of the prediction process,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}=\frac{E_{-i}-E}{E}=\frac{\left|\hat{y}_{-i}-y_{new}\right|-\left|\hat{y}-y_{new}\right|}{\left|\hat{y}-y_{new}\right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error,
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{-i}=\left|\hat{y}_{-i}-y_{new}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error without considering the proposition of prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}>0$
\end_inset

 then it means that removing agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 from the prediction group had a negative impact on the prediction error,
 meaning that agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 has a positive contribution to reducing the error locally and conversely for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}<0$
\end_inset

.
 This value indicates for a given point,
 which agents are strong and which are weak in predicting for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 We can therefore consider that weak agents need to improve their local model,
 while strong agents are already good and need to strengthen their local anchoring at the given point.
 This update rule allows for the continuous improvement of the group locally by improving the weakest agents while keeping them mobile,
 thus allowing them to position themselves elsewhere if needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have only one agent (
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

) that is neighbor to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 we can't update it according to the same rules.
 Indeed,
 we can't compare its contribution to the error using other neighors (as if 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore,
 we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

,
 the relative error reduction compared to a baseline prediction given by a running short term linear predictor
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}=\frac{E_{base}-E_{i}}{E_{base}}=\frac{\left|y_{base}-y_{new}\right|-\left|\hat{y}_{i}-y_{new}\right|}{\left|y_{base}-y_{new}\right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{base}$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error of the short term linear predictor,
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}=\left|\hat{y}_{i}-y_{new}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}>0$
\end_inset

 then it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 outperforms the short term linear predictor locally around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 giving indications that agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 might be useful locally,
 and conversely for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}<0$
\end_inset

.
 This value allows to estimate how expert the agent is relative to the short-term baseline.
 We can therefore consider that if the only neighbor agent is beaten by the baseline,
 then it probably shouldn't be a neighbor to this point.
 It should skip interacting this 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 waiting to reposition itself by ingesting new points,
 to be destroyed,
 or for another agent to become a neighbor in that area so they can improve together.
 Conversely,
 if it's better than the baseline,
 then it's a local expert whom we want to keep in that area since it represents the only knowledge we have about it.
 So,
 it should improve its local model and strengthen its local anchoring around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 This update rule allows single neighbors to specialize locally even when alone in an area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally if no agent is considered a neighbor (
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

),
 then we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 since as in the case 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

,
 there is no neighbor to compare to.
 Thus,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}>0$
\end_inset

,
 it means that the neared agent is more relevant than the short term linear predictor.
 Therefore,
 it seems that this agent should encompass the point and become its neighbor by improving its model and extending its shape towards 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}<0$

,
 it means that even the nearest agent is not relevant for prediction and therefore the system probably has no knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 and should add it to its knowledge base by covering the space around it by creating a new agent initialized from a short term containing last points seen by the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we create agents,
 we need a mechanism to destroy then.
 An,
 agent might position poorly in the feature space or choose to ingest the wrong points making its model no longer representative of the covered area.
 Decision errors happen almost all the time when working in an online setting because we have no knowledge to what the future points will look like.
 We can only guess from local relationshop between successive points.
 If no destruction mechanism is introduced to mitigate the proliferation of agents,
 the number of agents will grow indefinitely and performances will be hurt by bad agents,
 preventing local specialization in the system and ultimately dragging down the predictive accuracy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore,
 we define instantaneous normalized confidence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

 of an agent as the various feedbacks received by the agent
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{i}=\tanh\left(k\times\begin{cases}
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}} & \text{if}\,N>1\\
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime} & \text{else}
\end{cases}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the steepness of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tanh$
\end_inset

 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

,
 the running confidence of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the exponental moving average of successive instantaneous confidence values (i.e feedback values) received by the agent
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}\,|\,t+1}=\left(1-\lambda\right)\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}\,|\,t}+\lambda c_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 the smoothing factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The confidence value 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is calculated for each agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and updated each time 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

is selected as a neighbor to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 It allows to track its performance over the course of successive updates.

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}>0$

,
 it means that,
 on average,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is categorized as strong compared to other neighbors or the short-term baseline predictor,
 and conversely if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}<0$
\end_inset

.
 Confidence this allows us to distinguish between agents that strengthen the system and those that degrade it.
 We deduce that an agent whose trust falls below a certain threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{confidence}}$
\end_inset

 should be destroyed to allow the emergence of new and more efficient local structures.

To visualize the result of a learning and local cooperation of agents,
 we use a 1-dimensional example.
 We generate a small synthetic dataset from the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)+\epsilon\mathcal{N}\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 the noise scaling factor.
 We simulate online learning by sequentially feeding the agent one 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new},y_{new}$
\end_inset

 tuple at a time.
 Each point is only seen once during learning as this is an important property of an effective and rapid online learning algorithm especially useful in real time dynamics modeling.

 We can observe that the agents overlap and do not fit perfectly across their entire area of expertise;
 at the edges of agents the fit seems to have more errors and conversely on the center.
 This is the expected behavior resulting from the assumption of non-uniformity in the knowledge within areas of expertise.
 Finally,
 we observe that the overall predictions approximate closely the function considering the noise added to the data.
 It demonstrates kCELL's ability to generalize effectively by interpolation.
 This highlights the usefulness of a weighted aggregation function as presented in

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 for each environment.
 Across both environments,
 the MAE consistently decreases on the test set corresponding to the currently observed gravity value,
 indicating effective online adaptation to changes in dynamics (refer to semi-transparent red areas in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the InvertedPendulum environment,
 kCELL systematically outperforms Adaptive Hoeffding Trees when the training and testing gravity values coincide,
 exhibiting lower MAE throughout each stationary phase.
 This suggests that the local spatialized modeling strategy employed by kCELL allows more accurate approximation of the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional settings.
 For the Hopper environment,
 both approaches achieve comparable MAE across the different gravity regimes.
 However,
 we notice that the error curve of kCELL displays higher variance,
 reflecting the self organization mechanisms of agents (creation,
 destruction,
 updates).
 This could also be due to numerical out-of-distribution prediction instability of CELL approaches which is a known problem.
 Indeed,
 due to spatialization,
 kCELL is not designed to predict too far outside their domain of expertise leading to very low activation scores for far away points and potential numerical instabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 specifically for kCELL,
 we notice that for InvertedPendulum,
 transitions between gravity values lead to an increase in MAE on past test sets,
 seemingly reflecting partial forgetting of earlier dynamics.
 In contrast,
 for Hopper,
 kCELL exhibits stable MAE on previously encountered gravity values even after multiple regime changes,
 suggesting retiention of prior knowledge.

 each gravity change induces a short-term surge in the number of agents,

 This indicates a restructuring of the population,
 where novelty triggers agent creation and confidence-based mechanisms triggers destruction to eliminate less relevant agents.

 the number of agents grows monotonically throughout training.

 In InvertedPendulum,
 gravity changes coincide with abrupt drops in mean agent age.
 This means that the population becomes suddenly younger,
 which is consistent with the replacement of older agents by newly created ones following a shift in dynamics.
 This behavior aligns with a confidence-driven selection mechanism that favors agents specialized to the current dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Hopper however,
 the mean agent age increases almost constantly,
 with only minor decreases follwoing the first gravity change and a slight slowdown after the second.
 This indicates that older agents persist over time and are not fully displaced by newer ones,
 despite agent creations.

\begin_layout Standard
In the higher-dimensional Hopper environment,
 agent persistence can be explained by two non-exclusive mechanisms.
 First,
 it is possible that agents trained under earlier gravity settings retain partial competence in overlapping regions of the state-action space.
 Those agents are then incrementally adapted as new data arrives leading to multi-regime reuse.
 In this case the growth of agents can be explained mainly by the modeling complexity introduced by the change in dynamics.
 Second,
 high-dimensional effects may reduce the sensitivity of the Mahalanobis distance,
 yielding sparse activation of older agents that prevents both their meaningful adaption and confidence degradation.
 In this case,
 those agents can be considered as frozen because they are too tightly tied to previously visited regions that do not overlap with newly discovered ones after dynamic changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To disambiguate whether agent persistence in the Hopper environment arises from adaptive reuse or from limited cross-regime activation,
 we analyzed the activation patterns of the final agent population obtained after full training.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents a heatmap of agent activations for all training samples,
 where columns correspond to agents sorted by age (from oldest to youngest) and rows correspond to training data points (in order) aggregated into bins.
 The resulting heatmap exhibits distinct block patterns,
 with older agents primarily activated for samples from the earliest dataset and progressively younger agents ddominating activation for later datasets.
 We can also observe that the shape of the number of agents curve (presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) appears in the heatmap drawn by points where agents are the most active.
 This organization further indicates that agents remain selectively active for the dynamics under which they were trained and created rather than becoming inactive or obsolete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Complementary,
 we provide a two-dimensional UMAP

,
 with samples colored according to their corresponding gravity regime.
 The projection reveals a clear separation between training datasets,
 suggesting that changes in dynamics induce distinct regions in the state-action space.
 This structural separation provides a plausible explanation for the coexistence of multiple generations of agents.
 Because data from different dynamics regimes occupy largely disjoint regions,
 agents specialized to earlier dynamics remain relevant for their corresponding subspaces without interfering with those created for later regimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These analyses support the claim that agent retention in the Hopper environment is primarily driven by regime-specific specialization in a high-dimensional space,
 rather than by passive survival due to insufficient confidence updates that would prevent the destruction process.
 While Mahalanobis distance may lose discriminative power in higher dimensional spaces,
 the observed seperation of state-action distributions enables kCELL to maintain multiple local experts corresponding to different dynamics.
 This results in stable prediction performance across successive dynamics changes.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results presented suggest that kCELL is able to adapt to non-stationary dynamics through a combination of local specialization and structural plasticity with behaviors that depend strongly on the dimensionality and geometry of the feature space.
 In both environments,
 kCELL succesfully reduces prediction error on the currently observed dynamics demonstrating effective online adaptation without explicit task or concept drift detection modules.
 Compared to a Hoeffding Adaptive Tree baseline,
 kCELL achieves lower MAE for the low-dimensional InvertedPendulum environment when training and testing distributions coincide.
 It also achieves comparable performances for the higher-dimensional Hopper environment although with increased variability due to its structural adaptivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the InvertedPendulum environment,
 changes in dynamics induced a rapid loss of relevance of agents trained on previous dynamics leading to their destruction or adjustment.
 This is reflected by sharp drops in agent activation,
 decreases in mean agent age,
 temporary surges in the number of agents followed by a stabilization and the observed increase in MAE on previously encountered dynamics.
 These indicate a population renewal process driven by confidence degradation and agent replacement.
 In this setting,
 partial forgetting emerges as a natural consequence of the overlap between the geometry of different dynamics and reflects appropriate structural adaptation rather than failure of retention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast,
 the Hopper environment exhibits persistent agent populations and stable prediction performance across successive dynamics changes.
 Although the number of agents grows monotonically,
 confidence-based destruction prevents the survival of agents that negatively impact prediction accuracy.
 The absence of population turnover is therefore not attributable to ineffective agent pruning.
 Analysis of agent activations reveals a structured specialization pattern.
 The activation heatmap of the final agent population shows distinct blocks associated with different training phases.
 Older agents are selectively activated for earlier gravity regimes and younger agents for later ones.
 This organization indicates retention of regime-specific expertise rather than passive persistence of obsolete models.
 Indeed,
 the agents do not know when a new dynamics change might occur and which dynamics will replace the current one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This interpretation is further supported by the UMAP analysis of the training data,
 which reveals clear separation between datasets generated with different gravity values.
 The existence fo well-separated regions in the state-action space provides a plausible explanation for the coexistence of multiple generations of agents without destructive interference.
 Thus,
 in this case,
 high dimensionality enables to allocate distinct subsets of agents to different dynamics.
 Although Mahalanobis distance may lose discriminative precision as dimensionality increases,
 for this experiment with 11-dimensional states and 3-dimensional actions (resulting in a 14-dimensional input vector),
 the geometric separation induced by gravity changes appears sufficient to maintain effective specialization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the results suggest that kCELL implicitly adjusts the tradeoff between forgetting and retention based on the structure of the data distribution rather than relying on explicit task boundaries.
 In low-dimensional spaces,
 adaptation is achieved through agent replacement and partial forgetting,
 while in higher-dimensional settings with separable regimes,
 the system favors retention and specialization.
 These results highlight both the strength and current limitations of kCELL.
 It paves the way for future works on the use of more robust distance metrics and activation mechanisms to account for high-dimensional geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we highlight the ability to analyze kCELL through the spatial organization and activation patterns of agents as a key advantage in terms of interpretability.
 Introspection of agent properties allows to identify which regions of the state-action space correspond to different dynamics,
 to understand how the model responds to non-stationary conditions and to debug or reinfe learning mechanisms.
 This relates the properties we presented in section

 some related properties remain.

We introduced CELL (Context Ensemble Local Learning),
 an online machine learning framework.
 In this chapter,
 we demonstrate the use of CELL for solving complex control tasks without prior knowledge of system dynamics.
 CELL continuously learns the dynamics and is used as the predictive model within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For safe control tasks with hard operational constraints,
 we show that CELL's inherent local linearization enables a seamless integration with traditional non linear optimization methods such as Sequential Quadratic Programming.
 Moreover,
 the spatial organization of local experts provides a knowledge map of the model,
 allowing the control of the optimization process conservativeness to explore poorly modeled states or stay in well modeled regions.
 Building on this property,
 we propose a novel interpretability approach based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to analyze and quantify the impact of constraints on the optimization objective,
 establishing a baseline for unconstrained performance.

Indeed,
 when the number of features increases,
 it is much rarer for an agent to be considered a neighbor of a new point.
 Therefore,
 the amoung of data required for training is much greater,
 and the number of agents created grows rapidly.
 Thus,
 we identify a need to limit the growth in the number of agents to increase sample efficiency and limit redundancy in the knowledge base.
 Until now,
 to mitigate this problem,
 we needed to rely on hard-to-tune hyperparameters to define the initial size of agents on each feature

 However,
 GP have a high computational cost with a learning complexity of 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(kN^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 the number of training points and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the number of optimization steps to find optimal kernel parameters,
 which results from the inversion of the covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

.
 This makes GPs no able to handle large datasets.

\begin_layout Standard
Approximation methods like Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP) alleviate this scaling issue.
 Instead of using the whole training dataset to build the model,
 a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 inducing points (with 
\begin_inset Formula $N\gg M$
\end_inset

) are selected to represent the whole dataset.
 The inducing points allow for a cheaper low-rank representation for approximating the posterior distribution lowering the complexity to

Speed Recommendation:
 Industrial Use Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enforcement of the EU General Safety Regulation has accelerated the adoption of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) systems in new vehicles,
 emphasizing the need for reliable embedded speed recommendations.
 Unlike classical speed control approaches that are centered on vehicle dynamics modeling,
 speed recommendation requires reasoning that considers the driver in the loop,
 introducing behavioral variability and acceptance constraints.
 Designing deployable systems further demands attention to safety compliance,
 homologation requirements,
 robustness under sensor failure and potential impacts on energy consumption.
 In this chapter,
 we discuss these challenges and outline design principles for building speed recommendation systems suitable for real-world deployment and propose search directions to advance the field toward operational intelligent speed recommendation solutions.
