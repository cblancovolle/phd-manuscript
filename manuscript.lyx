This thesis is financed by an automotive company.
 Initially the goal was to work on intelligent speed recommendation.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In 1.
 I want to present why our company cares about speed recommendation.
 Then,
 in this part I also want to show a short review of literature to show that several speed management systems are considered in research:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Open Loop systems => that recommend speed to the driver via simple rule based approaches without considering any driver feedback => These approaches are more interpretable but limited in terms of objectives considered and do not enable personalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
- Closed Loop systems => that control the speed of the vehicle in an autonomous way => performance but no consideration of the driver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We notice that both approaches are inherently limited in their consideration of the driver.
 Indeed,
 in a speed recommendation context,
 the driver can delay,
 accept or refuse a speed recommendation set point.
 Moreover,
 as introducing the driver in the loop generates uncertainty because all human drivers are different,
 speed recommendations should be personalized to each one to better align with their driving style to maximize acceptance of recommendation set points.
 In addition to that,
 to maximize acceptance and the positive behavioral impact on driving,
 speed recommendation strategies should be interpretable to be able to justify their decisions to some extent to the driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To bridge the gap between performant autonomous approaches and speed recommendation systems,
 we propose to tackle the speed recommendation problem as a control problem under the assumption that the vehicle-driver system is continuously modeled to account for the non-stationarity of the driver behavior over his life.
 Formulated in this way,
 the speed recommendation problem is reduced to an adaptive control problem with a learned model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research investigates the use of local online learning methods based on multi-agent self organization mechanisms to control complex,
 non-stationary systems where the underlying dynamics are unknown beforehand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this work was initiated within the industrial framework of Intelligent Speed Recommendation for the automotive sector,
 we came to the conclusion that the fundamental scientific bottleneck lies in the ability of a controller to adapt continuously to non-stationary dynamics.
\end_layout

We structure the remainder of this introductory chapter as following.

 Studies have shown that vehicle speed control devices like Intelligent Speed Assist (ISA) could significantly contribute to the reduction of road accidents 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Moreover,
 better speed management can lead to significant reduction in energy consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 making this issue a strategic concern for individuals,
 but also for fleet management companies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Consequently,
 developing speed management technologies that help drivers maintain safe and efficient speeds is essential for public safety and for the sustainable development of the automotive industry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From an industrial perspective,
 the main challenge for developing intelligent speed recommendation devices lies in designing a system that effectively influence vehicle speed while maintaining a high level of user acceptance,
 safety and energy efficiency.
 As the driver can chose to 
\emph on
accept
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
delay
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
refuse
\emph default
 a recommended speed set point,
 the effectivenes of such recommendation systems is largely determined by the underlying control architecture and how it interacts with an unpredictable human driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research on speed management can be broken down into two distinct branches as displayed on Figure

Open loop systems correspond to systems that do not consider feedback from the driver or vehicle state.
 In the speed management literature,
 these works primarily focus on translating environment constraints such as traffic light timings

 Among the proposed approaches,
 some employ advanced optimization techniques like Pontryagin's Maximum Principle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to maximize energy efficiency.
 Others rely on passive infrastructure-based interventions ranging from physical enforcements via road bumps

 aiming at increasing speed awareness through environmental design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 whether digital or physical,
 these approaches share the same structural limitation because they assume that the recommendation set points are going to be followed perfectly and instantaneously.
 This assumption ignores the non-stationarity and variability of human-behavior.
 Consequently,
 without online feedback mechanisms to account for driver acceptance,
 the theoretical benefits of these optimizations are rarely fully realized in real-world conditions.

\begin_layout Standard
Works on closed-loop speed management systems are rooted in the development of autonomous vehicles.
 In a sense,
 they resolve the main limitation of open-loop systems by completely ignoring the driver and focusing solely on vehicle control.
 In this context,
 the system plays an active role in speed regulation by acting directly on low level vehicle's actuators (throttle / brake),
 thereby bypassing the uncertainties of driver acceptance.
 The related literature can be divided into two technical branches:
 
\emph on
model-based online planning
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
data-driven
\emph default
 approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the one hand,
 model-based online planning approaches rely extensively on approaches on physical models of the vehicle coupled with Model Predictive Control (MPC)

 or Dynamic Programming (DP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sunOptimalEcoDrivingControl2020"

\end_inset

.
 These approaches take into account changes in the environment by solving constrained optimization problems in real-time that mostly balance energy efficiency,
 safety and travel time.
 Since solving many optimization problems can be costly,
 research efforts have focused on finding analytical solutions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ozatayAnalyticalSolutionMinimum2014,malikopoulosOptimalControlSpeed2018,hanSafeEcoDrivingControl2018"

\end_inset

 or using discretization techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "jinPowerBasedOptimalLongitudinal2016,jinEnergyoptimalSpeedControl2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to solve the optimization problems.
 These methods offer rigorous safety and stability guarantees as they rely on pre-defined physical models coupled with control theory.
 However,
 the main limitation exposed for open-loops systems remains,
 as the human driver is excluded form the control loop,
 resulting in mostly unusable systems when considering a human driver controlling the vehicle.
 Moreover,
 the capabilities of the resulting controllers depend on the accuracy of the physical models used.
 To ensure the controller operates in real-time,
 it is often necessary to make compromises on the complexity and accuracy of the physical model,
 making it more difficult to handle larger number of variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand,
 data-driven approaches have emerged to address the limitations of physical modeling,
 particularly for capturing complex,
 non-linear behaviors that are difficult to formalize analytically.
 By leveraging Reinforcement Learning,
 data-driven approaches simplify multi-objective optimization through the design of reward functions that balance energy,
 safety and comfort

\end_inset

.
 However,
 these approaches rely on extensive and sample inefficient training,
 resulting in frozen policies that cannot adapt to the non-stationary nature of the road environment.
 Furthermore,
 compared to model-based methods,
 data-driven controllers lack formal safety and stability guarantees.
 They mostly rely on neural networks which make enforcing hard constraints difficult in safety-critical control systems due to the brittleness of their predictions outside the training distribution and to the interpretability of their inner workings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "zhang2020testing"

\end_inset

.
 Neural networks can be very successful but are black-boxes that are hard to trust and validate.
 Specifically in industrial safety critical use cases,
 the use of neural networks is mostly reduced to small certifiable networks,
 largely limiting the scalability potential

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite their differences,
 both model-based and data-driven closed-loop architectures share a common limitation:
 they prioritize the autonomy of the vehicle denying authority of the driver on his vehicle.
 Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) systems seek to tackle this limitation.
 These approaches attempt to reintegrate the driver into the control loop by treating human behavior as a dynamic variable of the problem rather than ignoring it by considering vehicle autonomy.
 In this field,
 literature focuses on personalizing speed recommendations by monitoring physiological signals such as heart rate to model stress levels

,
 or by estimating driver acceptance scores to modulate the speed recommendation strategy

 or use context-aware models to predict expert driver reactions on blind intersections

\end_inset

.
 These approaches represent significant step toward driver consideration into closed-loop systems.
 However,
 they still remain limited by their offline nature.
 Most of these HitL systems are built upon static databases or pre-trained driver profiles that fail to account for the variability of human driving behaviors and for the non-stationarity of those behaviors that can evolve over time.
 In reality,
 a driver's response is not a fixed parameter but a non-stationary process influenced by physiological states,
 environmental context and lon-term behavioral adaptation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The review of the literature on speed management systems reveals a significant gap in the state of the art.
 Open-loop advisory systems respect driver's autonomy but lack the consideration of feedbacks on driver's behavior to ensure high effectiveness.
 Conversely,
 closed-loop autonomous systems offer high performance and theoretical guarantees but exclude the human driver from the execution loop.
 Finally,
 Human-in-the-loop methods that try to reinsert the driver in the loop through personalization and data-driven approaches,
 are limited by their inability to adapt in real-time to non-stationary behavior and learn continuously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified a research gap in the lack of interpretable methods capable of learning continuously to adapt to the non-stationarity of the human driver behavior.
 Section

 shows that from the identified research gap,
 the industrial speed recommendation problem can be abstracted to a more fundamental scientific challenge which is the control of complex non-stationary systems.
 By considering the vehicle-driver plant as a whole with unknown non-stationary dynamics,
 the problem is reformulated as a task of Adaptive Control with a Learned Model which represents the core focus of this thesis.

Problem Statement

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address the gaps identified in the literature,
 this thesis proposes a shift in perspective.
 Rather than viewing speed recommendation as a static recommendation task,
 we treat it as a Human-Robot Collabotation (HRC) problem.
 For a robot to work effectively with humans,
 it requires anticipatory skills 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dani2024human"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The controller must infer the driver's intended motion and behavior to synchronize its recommendations effectively.
 By forecasting a human's response,
 the controller can provide set points that are complementary to the human's intent rather than being reactionary or disruptive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently,
 we propose to tackle the speed recommendation problem as a control problem under the assumption that the vehicle-driver plant is modeled as a whole.
 Given the non-stationarity and complexity of human behavior,
 this plant cannot be described by a static physical model.
 Instead,
 it must be continuously learned online from experience.
 Formulated in this way,
 the speed recommendation problem is abstracted into a problem of Adaptive Control that can be decomposed into two subproblems:
 
\series bold
online learning
\series default
 and 
\series bold
optimal control with learned model
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First,
 the online learning subproblem consists in the continuous generation of a predictive model 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 of the vehicle-driver dynamics from a stream of state-action pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[s_{t},u_{t}\right]\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}$
\end_inset

 maps a states and actions to next state prediction such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)=s_{t+1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then,
 the optimal control with learned model subproblem consists in the derivation of a control law that minimizes a cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 over a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 based on the predictions of the learned model 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve these subproblems in a non-stationary environment,
 we argue for the necessity of using a local learning approach in which the feature space is partitioned into regions managed by local experts.
 This choice is driven by the requirements for interpretability and real-time adaptability.
 In the context of HRC,
 interpretability may not be a strict mathematical requirement for control but it is a functional necessity to ensure system certifiability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kress2021formalizing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and to improve human trust toward the controller 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "anjomshoae2019explainable"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For safety,
 industrial standards require that the internal models driving the system's decisions be traceable and verifiable.
 This task remains notoriously difficult with black-box global approximators.
 For HRC,
 a human is more likely to accept and cooperate with a system whose behavior is predicatble and grounded in transparent logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local learning provides transparency by decomposing complex global dynamics into a set of specialized local models.
 Unlike global architectures where a single weight update can unpredictably affect the entire model,
 a local learning approach can ensure that any update stays local.
 This spatialization ensures that any prediction is traceable to a specific region of the feature space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 global approximation methods often struggle with the stability-plasticity dilemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mermillod2013stability"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where learning new behaviors leads to the forgetting of old ones.
 With local learning methods,
 the model can adapt to new behaviors locally and incrementally without corrupting knowledge stored in other regions.
 This allows the model to remain accurate across different driving contexts without requiring computationally heavy,
 and often impossible,
 offline training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The long-term goal of this research is to enable efficient HRC,
 specifically in the automotive sector.
 This goal depends on the reliability of the underlying control architecture.
 Therefore,
 this thesis does not address the high-level social or psychological aspects of HRC but rather the foundational subproblems required to make the best out of HRC:
 local online learning and control with learned models.
 The following section details our contributions to these two research fields.

Thus,
 from the previous statement,
 we deduce that to bridge the gap between performant autonomous approaches and speed recommendation systems,
 the speed recommendation problem can be tackled as a control problem under the assumption that the vehicle-driver system is continuously modeled to account for the non-stationarity of the driver behavior.
 Formulated in this way,
 the speed recommendation problem can be abstracted into an adaptive control problem with a learned model.
\end_layout

Therefore,
 the problem can be broken down into 2 subproblems:

\begin_layout Itemize
[SHOULD WE INTRODUCE LOCAL LEARNING HERE OR WAIT FOR STATE OF THE ART ?]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We notice that both approaches are inherently limited in their consideration of the driver.
 Indeed,
 in a speed recommendation context,
 the driver can delay,
 accept or refuse a speed recommendation set point.
 Moreover,
 as introducing the driver in the loop generates uncertainty because all human drivers are different,
 speed recommendations should be personalized to each one to better align with their driving style to maximize acceptance of recommendation set points.
 In addition to that,
 to maximize acceptance and the positive behavioral impact on driving,
 speed recommendation strategies should be interpretable to be able to justify their decisions to some extent to the driver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To bridge the gap between performant autonomous approaches and speed recommendation systems,
 we propose to tackle the speed recommendation problem as a control problem under the assumption that the vehicle-driver system is continuously modeled to account for the non-stationarity of the driver behavior over his life.
 Formulated in this way,
 the speed recommendation problem is reduced to an adaptive control problem with a learned model.

This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature on speed recommendation systems.
 We decompose the problem into two sub-problems:
 a 
\emph on
modeling problem
\emph default
,
 which involves continuously estimating vehicle dynamics under driver-specific influence to enable personalized and realistic speed recommendations;
 and a 
\emph on
control problem
\emph default
,
 which leverages the learned model to optimize speed profiles with respect to predefined objectives and operational constraints.
 To establish a rigorous foundation and position our approach within the field,
 we examine state-of-the-art methods across three relevant domains:
 speed control and recommendation,
 online machine learning and  optimal control.

Open-loop speed recommendation systems can be defined as all the speed management systems that consider the driver as an external component to the system.
 In this case the system do not receive the driver's response into the recommendation logic,
 ignoring if the driver accepts,
 delays or refuses the recommendation.
 Thus,
 the system works mainly as an information layer to the driver,
 translating environment and legal constraints into speed recommendation set points.

 In more recent years,
 reinforcement learning has been seriously considered to bypass the phase of designing rules that define agent behavior.
 Indeed,
 in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL),
 agents' behaviors are learned using reinforcement signals obtained by continuously interacting with an environment

 that combines both approaches to tackle online supervised learning problems.
 Agents of the system update using both reinforcement learning signals and cooperation rules.

Ensemble Learning

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve more accurate predictions and provide better approximations of nonlinear functions,
 it is common to aggregate multiple models for making predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensemble learning is based on the emergence of collective intelligence within a set of weak learners.
 A weak learner is a model whose performance is at least as good as a model making random predictions.
 During the learning process,
 a set of models (which may differ from one another) are trained in parallel or sequentially 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "polikarEnsembleLearning2012"

\end_inset

.
 The objective is to encourage diversity among the models so that they do not all capture the same patterns in the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dietterichEnsembleMethodsMachine2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 An input is transmitted to all weak learners,
 each of which makes a prediction proposal.
 A heuristic is implemented to select one of the proposals or to weight each of them in order to construct the final prediction.
 We distinguish several major approaches in ensemble learning which are Boosting,
 Bagging and Stacking.

In Bagging

 multiple models (usually homogeneous) are trained in parallel on different subsets of the training data to introduce diversity,
 reduce variance and improve stability.
 Then the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of the weak learners (regression) or by majority voting (classification).
 Unlike Bagging,
 in Boosting 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

,
 the models are trained sequentially.
 Each new model focuses on correcting the errors of the previous ones to reduce bias and improve accuracy.
 Then the final prediction is obtained from a weighted average of the predictions of the all the weak learners.
 Finally,
 there is Stacking 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wolpert1992stacked"

 that falls under meta-learning.
 We train in parallel a set of heterogeneous models and then a meta-model is trained to combine the predictions of each model to obtain the final output of the system,
 in order to capture complementary strengths of each learning algorithms involved in the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The family of systems presented in this chapter,
 CELL,
 falls within ensemble learning and we could label it as a Bagging approach because we consider a set of weak learners as a collection of self-organizing cooperative agents.

The main entities of oCELL are context agents.
 A context agent,
 denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}_{i}=\left\{ \phi_{i},f_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

is defined by two core components:
 an activation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 and a prediction function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The activation function determines whether the agent should contribute to the prediction for a given input 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 while the prediction function provides the corresponding output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each agent can adapt the parameters of its activation and prediction functions based on reinforcement signals derived from its performance,
 enabling it to refine its behavior according to local conditions in feature space.
 Conceptually,
 a context agent acts as a local expert for the target function with activation function governing

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure transparency and interpretability,
 oCELL spatialize context agents using orthotopes (also referred to as hyper-rectangles in the literature).
 Orthotopes provide a clear geometric representation of an agent's confidence region in the feature space,
 allowing precise evaluation of local structures and facilitating shape adaptation during self-organization.
 This representation allows independent manipulation of each feature dimension,
 simplifying expansion and retraction operations.

 These approaches typically partition the feature space into orthotopes and model the target function locally.
 For instance,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Agents in oCELL are constructed based on the assumption of uniform knowledge over their confidence region,
 i.e the area delimited by the associated orthotope.
 We distinguish between activation and neighborhood.
 When an agent is activated by a point,
 it means it is confident in its expertise to predict for that point.
 When an agent is a neighbor of a point,
 it means it has doubts about its expertise to predict for that point.
 In other words,
 it is an agent that is a candidate to become an activated agent for that point.
 The way an agent updates itself differs depending on whether the agent is activated or a neighbor.

,
 then the upper bounds

 of the associated orthotope are updated according to the following relationship:

\end{cases}\\
l_{j}^{t+1} & =\begin{cases}
\left(l_{j}^{t}-h_{j}^{t}\right)\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{k}}+h_{j}^{t} & \text{if }l_{j}^{t}\leq x_{j}\leq h_{j}^{t}\\
l_{j}^{t} & \text{else}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon=\begin{cases}
\left(1+\alpha\right) & \text{if expansion}\\
\left(1-\alpha\right) & \text{if retraction}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the number of features such that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}^{t}\leq x_{j}\leq h_{j}^{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
 the new volume of the orthotope associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is given by the relation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 agents are spatialized through activation functions defining orthotopes that represent their 
\emph on
confidence region
\emph default
 (i.e area of expertise) in feature space.
 Each agent can adapt its bounds,
 expanding or contracting its associated orthotope as needed.
 Intuitively,
 larger agents act as 
\emph on
generalists
\emph default
,
 while smaller agents serve as 
\emph on
specialists
\emph default
.
 Consequently,
 complex regions of feature space tend to host many small agents,
 whereas simpler regions tend to be covered by fewer larger agents.
 This assumption aligns with the use of simple local models such as linear regressions,
 which we leverage in subsequent experiments to demonstrate the transparency and interpretability of oCELL.

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of oCELL is to perform online regression from a continuous data stream.
 Spcifically,
 it aims at modeling the nonlinear dynamics of a complex system for subsequent use in an optimization pipeline for optimal control (see Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Solving-Control-Tasks"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore,
 it is desirable to minimize gradient noise and ensure the learned function is smooth,
 as irregularities can significantly disrupt the optimization process

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this,
 oCELL allows multiple agents to contribute to the final prediction,
 in contrast to previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "boesSelfAdaptiveContextLearning2015,dato2021apprentissage,fourezEnsembleMultiAgentSystem2022"

\end_inset

,
 where a single agent was ultimately selected for prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 from an observation 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 the most competent agents are selected to predict the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

.
 If some agents are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 then they each make a prediction proposal.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 has no neighbor,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-closest agents are selected instead.
 This fallback mechanism prevents prediction failures in regions where the system has limited knowledge (i.e poor paving of the area around 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 The final prediction is then given by the arithmetic mean of the proposals of selected agents such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{y}=\frac{1}{\left|D_{\text{selected}}\right|}\times\sum_{i\in D_{\text{selected}}}f_{i}\left(x\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\text{selected}}$
\end_inset

is the set of selected agents (neighbors or closest) and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 the internal prediction function of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

Learning Rules
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Learning-Rules"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL systems,
 the design of learning rules revolves around a set of actions and trigger conditions that decide how to digest the continuous stream of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{new},y_{new}\right)$
\end_inset

 data.
 Some actions are tied to individual agents such as updating their model (prediction function) or shape (activation function);
 and others are more meta-level actions such as destroying or creating new agents.
 These actions are triggered by conditions.
 In oCELL,
 those conditions depend on the number of current neighbors,
 on the number of activated agents and on a feedback values calculated from the proposals of selected agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the appropriate action for an agent,
 we define the prediction quality 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}=g\left(\hat{y},y\right)
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g:\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{m}\mapsto\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a distance measure between the proposal 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 and the true value 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 The largest 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
 the worse the quality of the proposal.
 In oCELL,
 we use the squared error as the 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 function but other types of error functions could be used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We define two thresholds 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{good}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{bad}}$
\end_inset

 to partition the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 into three regimes:
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 predictions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 predictions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{bad}},+\infty\right[$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
bad
\emph default
 predictions.
 These thresholds control the degree of accuracy expected from the system and influence the frequency of some rule activation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inaccuracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}\geq1$
\end_inset

 activated agents for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 it means the region around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 is already known because it is covered by agents.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 it means the prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 and it was right to declare itself as an expert on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 will therefore seek to generalize in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 by extending its area of expertise.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 then the prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 but not catastrophic,
 so it only refines its internal model and keeps its positions waiting for another signal to expand if needed.
 Then,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[\tau_{\text{bad}},+\infty\right[$
\end_inset

,
 the prediction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
bad,

\emph default
 meaning that it shouldn't have been activated.
 In reaction to that,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 will retract to get away from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 This rule is the core of agents local self-organization.
 It allows the agents to move in feature space and refine their model as needed to exclude or include points to better model their close surroundings in response to feedbacks on the quality of their predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Incompetence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}=0$
\end_inset

 activated agents and 
\begin_inset Formula $N\geq1$
\end_inset

 agents that are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 all of the closest agents are candidate on becoming activated on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 In this situation,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[0,\tau_{\text{good}}\right]\cup\left[\tau_{\text{good}},\tau_{\text{bad}}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 i.e prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
,
 then it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 could become an expert on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 so it refines its model and expands towards 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 Otherwise,
 if no neighbor gives 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 predictions,
 a new agent centered on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 is created.
 This rule promotes knowledge reuse and limit redundant agent creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Uselessness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice,
 we observe a need for agent destruction mechanisms within the system.
 Indeed,
 some agents may evolve into degenerate shapes if they receive too much negative feedbacks in a row.
 They become far too small to be informative.
 These 
\emph on
dead
\emph default
 agents most probably won't be activated ever again and are no longer useful in the system.
 Consequently,
 all agents whose volume falls below a certain threshold value 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{vol}}$
\end_inset

 are destroyed.

Therefore,
 oCELL relies on several hyperparameters that must be initialized prior to training.
 These parameters have an influence on the convergence of the system.
 These parameters include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial orthotope size (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

):
 determines the initial confidence region of newly created agents;
 overly small regions may hinder proper activation and make new agents overspecialize locally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prediction thresholds (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{bad}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{good}}$
\end_inset

):
 define accuracy regimes and influence rule activation frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Volume variation coefficient (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

):
 controls the rate of expansion or retraction of agents as a fraction of their current volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Destruction threshold (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{vol}}$
\end_inset

):
 specifies the minimum volume below which an agent is considered as a candidate for destruction.

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the performances of oCELL,
 we conducted a comparative study against standard machine learning algorithms on a regression task.
 This section outlines the experimental protocol and compare performances against various metrics.
 For this experiment,
 each context agent employs a linear regression as its internal model.
 This choice is motivated by the simplicity and transparency of the inner workings of linear transformations.
 This aligns with the design of oCELL and facilitate clear analysis of the system's behavior.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Experimental Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment is conducted on four two-dimensional benchmark functions commonly used in optimization research.
 These functions were selected due to their nonlinear characteristics and the challenges they present for optimization,
 particularly for gradient-based methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jamil2013ALS"

\end_inset

.
 This choice is motivated by the fact that state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

literal "false"

\end_inset

 partially rely on gradient-based optimization during the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure relevance of the evaluation while keeping it low-dimensional,
 we selected classical functions known for their optimization difficulty,
 characterized by multiple local optima and nonlinear variations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "aliNumericalEvaluationSeveral2005,Jamil2013ALS"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The functions considered are the SSR functions (
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x,y\right)=\sin\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right)$
\end_inset

),
 Booth,
 Goldstein-Price and  Beale functions (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 For each function,
 a synthetic dataset comprising 8000 observations was generated by uniformly sampling points within the feature space.

 oCELL achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and the highest coefficient of determination (
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2}$
\end_inset

) for all four functions.
 It also attains the best mean squared error (MSE) on the SSR,
 Goldstein-Price and  Booth functions,
 while XGBoost performs slightly better in terms of MSE on the Beale function.
 Overall,
 oCELL demonstrates comparable performances to XGBoost and LightGBM for most functions,
 while consistently outperforming the weak learners.
 These results indicate that oCELL effectively captures the nonlinear variations of the underlying functions from the data,
 as illustrated in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interpretability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
oCELL's design provides a basis for full model interpretability.
 When the agents employ inherently transparent models such as linear regression,
 oCELL itself works as a structurally interpretable white-box model in accordance with the definition introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:XAI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 The system's final prediction is derived from a linear combination of predictions proposed by a restricted,
 spatially-localized subset of agents.
 This mechanism simplifies the process of credit assigment compared to traditional global ensemble models (e.g bagging or boosting),
 which often involve contributions from a large set of weak learners.
 This property makes oCELL intrinsically interpretable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently the spatial organization and internal structures of the model can be systematically analyzed to extract essential information about the function underlying the data and its complexity.
 For didactic purposes,
 the remainder of this section is based on a training carried out on a synthetic dataset generated from the Beale function (cf.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Heatmaps"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 This nonlinear function exhibits regimes of amplitude variations that are very different across its domain of definition.
 The amplitude of the gradients of the Beale function varies greatly at the boundaries of the definition domain (
\begin_inset Formula $-4\leq x,y\leq4$
\end_inset

),
 while in the central plateau,
 the variations in gradient amplitude are more subtle.
 The Beale function is frequently used as a benchmark for testing optimization algorithms

Uncertainty and Confidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of neighborhood and more broadly the spatial organization of agents allows to extract various metrics of the local organization of agents in the feature space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Epistemic Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During training,
 the agents organize themselves in the feature space.
 Depending on the training dataset and the complexity of the underlying function,
 the results of self-organization varies.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Visualization-tiling-beale"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 gaps (uncovered zones) in the agent tiling may remain.
 It is possible that for a given observation,
 no agent is activated.
 In such cases,
 making a prediction requires relying on the proposals of the nearest agents in the observation's neighborhood.
 To determine if the agents' prediction is reliable,
 we define the coverage index 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 of the observation's neighborhood as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{\text{coverage}}=\frac{V_{\text{agents}}}{V_{\text{neighborhood}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\text{agents}}$
\end_inset

 is the volume covered by the 
\emph on
Context
\emph default
 agents in the neighborhood and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\text{neighborhood}}$
\end_inset

 is the volume of the hyperrectangle representing the neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

,
 the space around the observation contains few gaps:
 our model is proficient in that region of space.
 Therefore,
 it is relevant to consider the predictions of nearby agents.
 Conversely,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{coverage}}$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

,
 then the space around the observation contains many gaps.
 There is a high probability that this region of space was underexplored during training.
 This may indicate either gaps in the training data specific to that area of space,
 or that training did not proceed as expected for various reasons (strong non-linearities in the function to approximate,
 presence of noise,
 discontinuity,
 etc...).
 We illustrate the utility of the coverage index in a scenario where our system learns from a dataset with an entire portion of missing data 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Comparison-coverage-index"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 We observe that the coverage index helps identify the missing portion of data in the training dataset without having directly access to the actual training dataset.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covergae index is therefore a quantitative measure of the epistemic uncertainty associated with a prediction.
 it provides a direct assessment of the model's learned boundaries and limitations in various regions of the feature space.
 For the development of critical systems,
 this property is essential to observe in order to assess the risk of extrapolation or interpolation errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This measure is fundamentally linked to both explainability and interpretability.
 Locally,
 at the individual prediction level,
 coverage index serves as a crucial component of explanation.
 By quantifying the reliability of the output,
 it effectively represents a degree of trustworhtiness and the necessity of relying on neighborhood averaging (cf.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsubsec:Neighborhood-Prediction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 Globally,
 the aggregated coverage index allows for the systematic analysis and visualization of the entire agent organization across the feature space.
 This analysis of the overall tiling pattern directly addresses interpretability by giving tools for understanding the model's inherent structure and mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Aleatoric Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After training,
 when an observation is provided to the model,
 each activated agent makes a prediction proposal.
 We can thus calculate the discrepancy between the prediction proposals from the set of proposals of the activated agents (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}$
\end_inset

) to deduce a measure of aleatoric uncertainty:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{activated}}=\sqrt{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}}\frac{\left|p-p_{\text{mean}}\right|}{N_{A}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{mean}}$
\end_inset

 is the average of the proposals in the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{A}$
\end_inset

 is the number of activated agents.
 This value estimates the disagreement among agents which judge themselves as equally competent to propose a prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This value of discrepancy quantifies the aleatoric uncertainty associated with the model's predictions.
 It captures the inherent noise and stochasticity as a disagreement among locally activated agents.
 It's linked to explainability because it primarily relates to locality at the prediction-level,
 providing useful tools to explain predictions under the angle of trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then,
 as oCELL is agnostic of the internal model of the agents that compose it,
 it is possible to use a class of models capable of inherently providing a measure of uncertainty on predictions,
 such as Gaussian Processes.
 Those are models which allow estimation of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "schulzTutorialGaussianProcess2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Exploiting the strength of this type of model could make the estimation of aleatoric uncertainty more robust.
 Indeed,
 several activated agents are needed for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\text{activated}}$
\end_inset

 to be informative,
 using Gaussian Processes would allow to still have a discrepancy value to use even when only one agent is activated.
 To overcome this drawback,
 we present later a generalization of this metric so that it can be used to analyze the geometric structures formed by agents during learning.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Variations of the Underlying Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of an agent depends on the region of space it occupies.
 Moreover,
 within its confidence area delimited by the orthotope associated to its activation function,
 the function underlying the data is locally approximable by a simple model.
 Therefore,
 in a region containing a large number of agents,
 variations in the underlying function are likely to be more 
\emph on
difficult
\emph default
 to learn.
 Thus,
 we define the density of agents around an observation as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{N_{\text{agents}}}{V_{\text{neighborhood}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\text{neighborhood}}$
\end_inset

 is the volume of the orthotope representing the neighborhood and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{agents}}$
\end_inset

 is the number of agents intersecting it.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Visualization-density"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 shows the density of agents in the input variable space for the Beale function.
 We observe a corridor in the center of the figure for 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

 where the density of agents is low.
 In the rest of the figure,
 the density of agents is higher.
 By examining the distribution of the average volume of agents in the neighborhood of observations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Visualization-volume"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

),
 we note that areas with high agent density contain smaller agents and  conversely for low-density areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two regions correspond to very different variation regimes of the Beale function.
 Indeed,
 the region containing the largest agents (low density) corresponds to a plateau where the gradient magnitude of the function varies little.
 In contrast,
 the region containing the smallest agents (higher density) corresponds to a region of space where the gradient magnitude of the function varies strongly as one approaches the boundary of the definition area (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Visualization-density"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 to complete the analysis,
 we define the degree of discrepancy 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 (which is a derivative of the discrepancy of activated agents 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\text{activated}}$
\end_inset

 presented earlier) among the predictions of all agents in the neighborhood (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}$
\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\kappa=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{p\in\mathcal{D}_{\text{proposals}}}\frac{\left|p-p_{\text{mean}}\right|}{N}}}{\left|y_{\text{mean}}\right|}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of agents in the neighborhood and  
\begin_inset Formula $y_{\text{mean}}$
\end_inset

 is the average of predictions from the agents in the neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

,
 then the predictions of the agents in the neighborhood are very close to each other.
 This indicates that the underlying function of the data varies little around the observation.
 Conversely,
 if its value is high,
 then the agents in the neighborhood make very different predictions,
 suggesting that the regime of variation of the underlying function is likely to change abruptly in that area.
 The degree of discrepancy helps identify regions in the input space where approximating the underlying function is most challenging.
 For the Beale function,
 the degree of discrepancy highlights regions of the space with the most complex variations (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Visualization-discrepancy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 where the yellow areas represent the highest disagreement between agents).

We have extracted measures of epistemic (coverage index) and aleatoric (activated discrepancy) uncertainty from the predictions of the system as well as information about the variations of underlying function from the shape (volume and density) and spatial organization of agents in the feature space (degree of discrepancy).
 These introspection tools reveal capabilities that are useful for various purposes such as fault detection,

Limitations
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Limitations"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We demonstrated that oCELL can address supervised learning tasks,
 but several limitations remain,
 which are tackled partly in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:kCELL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first limitation concerns the neighborhood prediction mechanism.
 Our current design assumes that an agent possesses uniform knwoledge throughout its activation region (the orthotope associated with its activation function).
 In practice,
 an agent is typically more reliable near its centroid and less accurate near the boundaries of its region.
 Despite this,
 all agents contributing to a prediction currently receive equal weight.
 This is an artifact of the uniform-knowledge assumption.
 A more principle approach would weight each agent according to its estimated local expertise level at the query point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We explored this idea by weighting predictions using the Euclidean distance between the input and each agent's centroid,
 but this did not improve performance,
 likely because centroid distance alone does not reflect the whole geometry of each orthotope.
 A more appropriate distance measure should incorporate both the agent's centroid and the shape of its support.
 As illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Limitation orthotope agents"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 (side by side comparison of an overgeneralizing agent and a representative agent by visualizing their respective orthotopes (represented by a blue rectangle) and training data (represented by red dots)),
 an agent may occupy a large orthotope while its training data populate only a small manifold (i.e a subregion),
 causing spurious known-region responses and false positives.
 Accurate spatialization and potentially richer base shapes is therefore essential to capture local data structures and prevent overgeneralization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 we observed that oCELL's agent destruction mechanism was inadequate.
 Agent overproduction was a frequently observed phenomenon,
 occasionally resulting in significant local redundancy and the persistence of harmful parasitic agents within the collective.
 This necessitates the development of more sophisticated destruction strategies explicitly designed to enforce local cooperation.
 In addition to that,
 the current single-point agent creation scheme seems too limited,
 as it directly contributes to local redundancy (slow local convergence).
 It should be more stable to initialize agents using multiples points to minimize local overlap and make local convergence faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 we observed that oCELL's agent destruction system was not sufficient and that agent overproduction was fairly common,
 sometimes leading to high local redundancy and the persistence of agents that parasitize the collective without improving it.
 This highlights a need for smarter destruction mechanisms that are designed towards local cooperation and more efficient agent creation schemes because creating agents with only one point can cause high local redundancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 although oCELL is designed for online learning,
 it treats incoming samples as independent,
 failing to exploit temporal correlations in data streams.
 This limits its sample efficiency and reduces its ability to adapt to evolving distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 some hyperparameters remain difficult to tune.
 In particular,
 the initial side lengths of newly created agents have a disproportionate impact on performance and require specifying a scale per feature dimension.
 Similarly,
 the error thresholds used to classify predictions as 
\emph on
good
\emph default
,
 
\emph on
inaccurate
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
bad
\emph default
 are hard to tune properly to enable an efficient balence in the triggering of the various adaptation mechanisms or agents (i.e learning rules).

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together,
 these limitations expose a broader structural issue.
 oCELL relies on spatialization and prediction aggregation mechanisms that are too rigid.
 The orthotope representation is too coarse to support reliable interpolation when agents overlap or specialize unevenly.
 These limitations also highlight the need for inference machanisms that weight agents according to their estimated expertise level rather than using discrete activations.
 These considerations motivate the design of a new CELL system in which spatialization,
 inference and adaptation are grouned in smoother data representations.

kCELL:
 Multiagent Ensemble Learning with Kernel Spatialization
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:kCELL"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Building upon the limitations of oCELL,
 we introduce kCELL (kernel CELL),
 the second instantiation of the CELL paradigm.
 With oCELL,
 we demonstrated that a population of agents can achieve competitive performance and provide valuable introspection signals such as epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates and qualitative information about local function variations.
 However,
 its rigid spatial representation ultimately limits its ability to build reliable and adaptive regions of expertise.
 This constraint becomes problematic when there is need for fast adaptation in an online setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kCELL addresses these issues by replacing orthotope-based spatialization with a kernel-based representation.
 Each agent has its activation function in the form of a RBF kernel that defines a smooth continuous distance between input features and agents,
 drawing inspiration from RBF Networks

 and MoE (Mixture of Experts)

\end_inset

 gating mechanisms.
 This change allows the system to express spatial structures more finely,
 with more degrees of freedom than what is permitted with orthotopes,
 thus breaking the assumption of knowledge uniformity over the region of expertise of oCELL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to that,
 kCELL introduces a smooth aggregation rule in which agents contribute to predictions proportionally to their kernel-defined relevance,
 i.e proportionally to their estimated expertise level.
 This brings the inference closer to the probabilistic weighting strategies used in Gaussian Processes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those reasons kCELL improves interpolation quality,
 agents' data representations and yield more stable learning dynamics that are less dependent on brittle hyperparameters,
 which is better suited for online adaptive learning.
 kCELL is a more expressive and robust extension of the CELL paradigm that also preserves the explainability properties demonstrated with oCELL.

However,
 unlike in oCELL,
 the Context agents of kCELL are spatialized differently.
 In oCELL,
 a binary activation (the point is inside or outside the associated orthotope) is used while in kCELL,
 a RBF kernel is used as a continuous and smooth activation function to represent the area of expertise in feature space.

First,

 This activation function is smooth and differentiable,
 making the system more optimization-friendly to be used for control tasks as a dynamics model.
 Therefore,
 an agent is spatialized by the mean

\end_inset

 and covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$

 of the distribution of its training points.
 Since this activation function has statistical significance,
 it is easier to define the neighborhood as a confidence interval whose confidence value can be adjusted.

,
 an explainability metric derived from oCELL which is also linked to the degree of knowledge of a point.
 In kCELL,
 this explainability property related to the knowledge of a point emerges naturally from the definition of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
One of the requirements of kCELL is to be lightweight,
 meaning that as few points as possible should be retained in memory to truly represent information through local models.
 As previously stated,
 the spatialization of each agent can be fully described by a mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and a covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 which are the parameters of the activation function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$

 Each time a point is ingested by agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 its mean and covariance matrix are updated using the Welford's algorithm

\Sigma_{i\,|\,t+1} & = & \frac{1}{n}\left(\Sigma_{i\,|\,t+1}+\left(x-\mu_{i\,|\,t}\right)\left(x-\mu_{i\,|\,t+1}\right)^{\top}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of points ingested by the agent to update its shape.
 With this approach the shape change is expressed purely as a mean and covariance estimation problem.

 The volume of an agent is tied to the volume of a confidence ellipsoid defined by a theshold on squared mahalanobis distance.
 Thus the volume of an agent is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the associated covariance matrix

\begin_layout Standard
In kCELL,
 we get rid of the knowledge uniformity hypothesis of agents to better represent the knowledge of the system.
 Therefore the activation function of a context agent materializes its area of expertise through a smooth RBF kernel.
 The further a point is from the agent's centroid,
 the lower its activation value.
 This is because we assume that expertise is maximized at the agent's center.
 Agents with higher activation values contribute more heavily to the final output because they are more expert than others at predicting.

\begin_inset Formula $S_{k}=\left\{ i|\mathcal{A}_{i}\,\text{is in the \ensuremath{k}-closest to}\,x\right\} $

\end_inset

 nearest agents in feature space.
 The final prediction 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 of the system is then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(x\right)=\sum_{i\in S_{k}}w_{i}\left(x\right)f_{i}\left(x\right)

\begin_layout Subsection
Learning Rules
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:kCELL-Learning-Rules"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in oCELL,
 learning rules are designed around a set of actions and conditions that triggers those actions to digest 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new},y_{new}$
\end_inset

 that are fed to the system sequentially as a data stream.
 In context agent learning systems,
 the set of actions consists of the actions that can be performed individually by agents such as updating their model or shape;
 and more meta-level actions such as destroying or creating new agents.
 These actions are triggered by conditions that generally depend on two factors:
 the number of current neighbors and a feedback value calculated from the proposals of selected agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

 agents that are neighbors of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 all of those agents are theoretically considered as experts to predict for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 As the final prediction of the system 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 is computed from the proposals of all those agents,
 the agents need to cooperate together locally to improve the local knowledge.
 For this purpose,
 we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

,
 the fractional change in error when leaving agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 out of the prediction process,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}=\frac{E_{-i}-E}{E}=\frac{\left|\hat{y}_{-i}-y_{new}\right|-\left|\hat{y}-y_{new}\right|}{\left|\hat{y}-y_{new}\right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error,
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{-i}=\left|\hat{y}_{-i}-y_{new}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error without considering the proposition of prediction of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}>0$
\end_inset

 then it means that removing agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 from the prediction group had a negative impact on the prediction error,
 meaning that agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 has a positive contribution to reducing the error locally and conversely for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}<0$
\end_inset

.
 This value indicates for a given point,
 which agents are strong and which are weak in predicting for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 We can therefore consider that weak agents need to improve their local model,
 while strong agents are already good and need to strengthen their local anchoring at the given point.
 This update rule allows for the continuous improvement of the group locally by improving the weakest agents while keeping them mobile,
 thus allowing them to position themselves elsewhere if needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When there is only one agent (
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

) that is neighbor to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 it can't be updatd according to the same rules.
 Indeed,
 its contribution to the error cannot be compared to the ones of other neighors (as if 
\begin_inset Formula $N>1$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore,
 we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

,
 the relative error reduction compared to a baseline prediction given by a running short term linear predictor
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}=\frac{E_{base}-E_{i}}{E_{base}}=\frac{\left|y_{base}-y_{new}\right|-\left|\hat{y}_{i}-y_{new}\right|}{\left|y_{base}-y_{new}\right|}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{base}$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error of the short term linear predictor,
 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}=\left|\hat{y}_{i}-y_{new}\right|$
\end_inset

 is the prediction error of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}>0$
\end_inset

 then it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 outperforms the short term linear predictor locally around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 giving indications that agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 might be useful locally and  conversely for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}<0$
\end_inset

.
 This value allows to estimate how expert the agent is relative to the short-term baseline.
 We can therefore consider that if the only neighbor agent is beaten by the baseline,
 then it probably shouldn't be a neighbor to this point.
 It should skip interacting this 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{new}$
\end_inset

,
 waiting to reposition itself by ingesting new points,
 to be destroyed,
 or for another agent to become a neighbor in that area so they can improve together.
 Conversely,
 if it is better than the baseline,
 then it is a local expert whom should stay in that area since it represents the only local source of knowledge.
 So,
 it should improve its local model and strengthen its local anchoring around 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 This update rule allows single neighbors to specialize locally even when alone in an area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally if no agent is considered a neighbor (
\begin_inset Formula $N=0$
\end_inset

),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is computed since as in the case 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1$
\end_inset

,
 there is no neighbor to compare to.
 Thus,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}>0$
\end_inset

,
 it means that the neared agent is more relevant than the short term linear predictor.
 Therefore,
 it seems that this agent should encompass the point and become its neighbor by improving its model and extending its shape towards 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime}<0$
\end_inset

,
 it means that even the nearest agent is not relevant for prediction and therefore the system probably has no knowledge of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

 and should add it to its knowledge base by covering the space around it by creating a new agent.
 To avoid initializing the new agent with only one point (as in oCELL) and accelerate local convergence,
 it is initialized from a short term buffer containing last points seen by the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since agents are created,
 a destruction mechanism is needed.
 An,
 agent might position poorly in the feature space or choose to ingest the wrong points making its model no longer representative of the covered area.
 Decision errors happen almost all the time when working in an online setting because it is impossible to know what the future points will look like.
 It can only be guessed from local relationships between successive points.
 If no destruction mechanism is introduced to mitigate the proliferation of agents,
 the number of agents will grow indefinitely and performances will be hurt by bad agents,
 preventing local specialization in the system and ultimately dragging down the predictive accuracy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore,
 we define instantaneous normalized confidence 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

 of an agent as the various feedbacks received by the agent
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{i}=\tanh\left(k\times\begin{cases}
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}} & \text{if}\,N>1\\
\Delta_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}^{\prime} & \text{else}
\end{cases}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the steepness of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tanh$
\end_inset

 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then,
 we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}\in\left[-1,1\right]$
\end_inset

,
 the running confidence of agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the exponental moving average of successive instantaneous confidence values (i.e feedback values) received by the agent
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}\,|\,t+1}=\left(1-\lambda\right)\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}\,|\,t}+\lambda c_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 the smoothing factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The confidence value 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is calculated for each agent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and updated each time 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}_{i}$
\end_inset

is selected as a neighbor to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new}$
\end_inset

.
 It allows to track its performance over the course of successive updates.

 it means that,

\end_inset

 is categorized as strong compared to other neighbors or the short-term baseline predictor and  conversely if 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{C}_{\mathcal{A}_{i}}<0$
\end_inset

.
 Confidence this allows us to distinguish between agents that strengthen the system and those that degrade it.
 We deduce that an agent whose trust falls below a certain threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\text{confidence}}$

 should be destroyed to allow the emergence of new and more efficient local structures.

To visualize the result of a learning and local cooperation of agents,
 we use a 1-dimensional example.
 We generate a small synthetic dataset from the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)+\epsilon\,\mathcal{N}\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 the noise scaling factor.
 We simulate online learning by sequentially feeding the agent one 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{new},y_{new}$
\end_inset

 tuple at a time.
 Each point is only seen once during learning as this is an important property of an effective and rapid online learning algorithm especially useful in real time dynamics modeling.

 We can observe that the agents overlap and do not fit perfectly across their entire area of expertise;
 at the edges of agents the fit seems to have more errors and conversely on the center.
 This is the expected behavior resulting from the assumption of non-uniformity in the knowledge within areas of expertise.
 Finally,
 we observe that the overall predictions approximate closely the function considering the noise added to the data.
 It demonstrates kCELL's ability to generalize effectively by interpolation.
 This highlights the usefulness of a weighted aggregation function as presented in

The environments were selected to contrast a low-dimensional setting (InvertedPendulum with 4-dimensional states and 1 action) with a higher-dimensional one (Hopper with 11-dimensional state and 3 actions).
 Mahalanobis distance values become larger the higher the number of dimensions.
 Thus we want to study the impact of increasing dimensionality on the representativity of the spatialization of kCELL which was one of the main limitations of oCELL (cf

Prediction Error Analysis

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 illustrates the evolution of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for kCELL and Adaptive Hoeffding Trees algorithms measured on the test sets associated with each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 for each environment.
 Across both environments,
 the MAE consistently decreases on the test set corresponding to the currently observed gravity value,
 indicating effective online adaptation to changes in dynamics (refer to semi-transparent red areas in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Visualization-of-mae-dynamic-changes"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the InvertedPendulum environment (cf.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Evolution-of-mae-dynamic-changes-invertedpendulum"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

),
 kCELL systematically outperforms Adaptive Hoeffding Trees when the training and testing gravity values coincide,
 exhibiting lower MAE throughout each stationary phase.
 This suggests that the local spatialized modeling strategy employed by kCELL allows more accurate approximation of the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional settings.
 For the Hopper environment (cf.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Visualization-of-mae-dynamic-changes-hopper"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

),
 both approaches achieve comparable MAE across the different gravity regimes.
 However,
 we notice that the error curve of kCELL displays higher variance,
 reflecting the self organization mechanisms of agents (creation,
 destruction,
 updates).
 This could also be due to numerical out-of-distribution prediction instability of CELL approaches which is a known problem.
 Indeed,
 due to spatialization,
 kCELL is not designed to predict too far outside their domain of expertise leading to very low activation scores for far away points and potential numerical instabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For kCELL,
 we notice that for InvertedPendulum,
 transitions between gravity values lead to an increase in MAE on past test sets,
 seemingly reflecting partial forgetting of earlier dynamics.
 In contrast,
 for Hopper,
 kCELL exhibits stable MAE on previously encountered gravity values even after multiple regime changes,
 suggesting retiention of prior knowledge.

 As previously hinted by MAE analysis,

),
 each gravity change induces a short-term surge in the number of agents,
 followed by a reduction and stabilization around a nominal value.
 This indicates a restructuring of the population,
 where novelty triggers agent creation and confidence-based mechanisms triggers destruction to eliminate less relevant agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Hopper (cf.

LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Visualization-of-nb-agents-hopper"

 the number of agents grows monotonically throughout training.
 Distinct growth regimes are observed for each gravity value with first a logaritmic growth (
\begin_inset Formula $g=9.81$

),
 second a seemingly linear growth (
\begin_inset Formula $g=4$
\end_inset

) and third a slight logarithmic growth (
\begin_inset Formula $g=20$

 This accumulation of agents suggests a continuous detection of local dynamics without systematic removal of existing agents.

),
 gravity changes coincide with abrupt drops in mean agent age.
 This means that the population becomes suddenly younger,
 which is consistent with the replacement of older agents by newly created ones following a shift in dynamics.
 This behavior aligns with a confidence-driven selection mechanism that favors agents specialized to the current dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Hopper (cf.

) however,
 the mean agent age increases almost constantly,
 with only minor decreases follwoing the first gravity change and a slight slowdown after the second.
 This indicates that older agents persist over time and are not fully displaced by newer ones,
 despite agent creations.

\begin_layout Standard
In the higher-dimensional Hopper environment,
 agent persistence can be explained by two non-exclusive mechanisms.
 First,
 it is possible that agents trained under earlier gravity settings retain partial competence in overlapping regions of the state-action space.
 Those agents are then incrementally adapted as new data arrives leading to multi-regime reuse.
 In this case the growth of agents can be explained mainly by the modeling complexity introduced by the change in dynamics.
 Second,
 high-dimensional effects may reduce the sensitivity of the Mahalanobis distance,
 yielding sparse activation of older agents that prevents both their meaningful adaption and confidence degradation.
 In this case,
 those agents can be considered as frozen because they are too tightly tied to previously visited regions that do not overlap with newly discovered ones after dynamic changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To disambiguate whether agent persistence in the Hopper environment arises from adaptive reuse or from limited cross-regime activation,
 we analyze the activation patterns of the final agent population obtained after full training.
 Figure

\end_inset

 presents a heatmap of agent activations for all training samples,
 where columns correspond to agents sorted by age (from oldest to youngest) and rows correspond to training data points (in order) aggregated into bins.
 The resulting heatmap exhibits distinct block patterns,
 with older agents primarily activated for samples from the earliest dataset and progressively younger agents ddominating activation for later datasets.
 We can also observe that the shape of the number of agents curve (presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) appears in the heatmap drawn by points where agents are the most active.
 This organization further indicates that agents remain selectively active for the dynamics under which they were trained and created rather than becoming inactive or obsolete.

\begin_layout Standard
Complementary,

,
 with samples colored according to their corresponding gravity regime.
 The projection reveals a clear separation between training datasets,
 suggesting that changes in dynamics induce distinct regions in the state-action space.
 This structural separation provides a plausible geometric explanation for the coexistence of multiple generations of agents.
 Because data from different dynamics regimes occupy largely disjoint regions,
 agents specialized to earlier dynamics remain relevant for their corresponding subspaces without interfering with those created for later regimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These analyses support the claim that agent retention in the Hopper environment is primarily driven by regime-specific specialization in a high-dimensional space,
 rather than by passive survival due to insufficient confidence updates that would prevent the destruction process.
 While Mahalanobis distance may lose discriminative power in higher dimensional spaces,
 the observed seperation of state-action distributions enables kCELL to maintain multiple local experts corresponding to different dynamics.
 This results in stable prediction performance across successive dynamics changes.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results presented suggest that kCELL were able to adapt to non-stationary dynamics through a combination of local specialization and structural plasticity with behaviors that depend strongly on the dimensionality and geometry of the feature space.
 In both environments,
 kCELL succesfully reduces prediction error on the currently observed dynamics demonstrating effective online adaptation without explicit task or concept drift detection modules.
 Compared to a Hoeffding Adaptive Tree baseline,
 kCELL achieves lower MAE for the low-dimensional InvertedPendulum environment when training and testing distributions coincide.
 It also achieves comparable performances for the higher-dimensional Hopper environment although with increased variability due to its structural adaptivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the InvertedPendulum environment,
 changes in dynamics induced a rapid loss of relevance of agents trained on previous dynamics leading to their destruction or adjustment.
 This is reflected by sharp drops in agent activation,
 decreases in mean agent age,
 temporary surges in the number of agents followed by a stabilization and the observed increase in MAE on previously encountered dynamics.
 These indicate a population renewal process driven by confidence degradation and agent replacement.
 In this setting,
 partial forgetting emerges as a natural consequence of the overlap between the geometry of different dynamics and reflects appropriate structural adaptation rather than failure of retention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast,
 the Hopper environment exhibits persistent agent populations and stable prediction performance across successive dynamics changes.
 Although the number of agents grows monotonically,
 confidence-based destruction prevents the survival of agents that negatively impact prediction accuracy.
 The absence of population turnover is therefore not attributable to ineffective agent pruning.
 Analysis of agent activations reveals a structured specialization pattern.
 The activation heatmap of the final agent population shows distinct blocks associated with different training phases.
 Older agents are selectively activated for earlier gravity regimes and younger agents for later ones.
 This organization indicates retention of regime-specific expertise rather than passive persistence of obsolete models.
 Indeed,
 the agents do not know when a new dynamics change might occur and which dynamics will replace the current one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This interpretation is further supported by the UMAP analysis of the training data,
 which reveals clear separation between datasets generated with different gravity values.
 The existence fo well-separated regions in the state-action space provides a plausible explanation for the coexistence of multiple generations of agents without destructive interference.
 Thus,
 in this case,
 high dimensionality enables to allocate distinct subsets of agents to different dynamics.
 Although Mahalanobis distance may lose discriminative precision as dimensionality increases,
 for this experiment with 11-dimensional states and 3-dimensional actions (resulting in a 14-dimensional input vector),
 the geometric separation induced by gravity changes appears sufficient to maintain effective specialization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the results suggest that kCELL implicitly adjusts the tradeoff between forgetting and retention based on the structure of the data distribution rather than relying on explicit task boundaries.
 In low-dimensional spaces,
 adaptation is achieved through agent replacement and partial forgetting,
 while in higher-dimensional settings with separable regimes,
 the system favors retention and specialization.
 These results highlight both the strength and current limitations of kCELL.
 It paves the way for future works on the use of more robust distance metrics and activation mechanisms to account for high-dimensional geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we highlight the ability to analyze kCELL through the spatial organization and activation patterns of agents as a key advantage in terms of interpretability.
 Introspection of agent properties allows to identify which regions of the state-action space correspond to different dynamics.
 This provide understanding on how the model responds to non-stationary conditions which can be useful to debug,
 refine learning mechanisms or build fallback strategies.
 This relates to the properties we presented in section

 showing that despite the design differences with oCELL,
 some related properties remain.

 we introduced the CELL (Context Ensemble Local Learning) paradigm,
 which provides the core hypothesis and theoretical ground for designing spatialized multiagent learning systems.
 Within this paradigm,
 algorithms such as oCELL and kCELL rely on a population of agents spatialized in feature space.
 Each agent learns a local predictive model from a stream of data.
 These online learning systems exhibit intrinsic interpretability and explainability properties that arise from the spatial organization of agents,
 spatialized local learning and agent-level interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter investigates how these properties can be exploited for model-based control with learned model without prior knowledge of system dynamics.
 In this setting,
 control policies are built from the combination of a learned predictive model and an optimizer.
 This corresponds to the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework,
 in which control actions are obtained by repeatedly optimizing predicted trajectories over a finite horizon

When the predictions of learned models lie outside the regions in the state-action space that have been sufficiently represented in the training data,
 the model is inherently limited in terms of accuracy.
 This limitation needs to be considered in optimal control problems involving hard constraints related to safety,
 stability or physical feasibility

 Indeed,
 unreliable predictions lead to unreliable optimization results.

kCELL provides a more robust and expressive instantiation of the CELL paradigm.
 It is capable of handling non-stationary online learning tasks and maintaining interpretability.
 However,
 its practical deployment in model-based control requires additional computational and structural considerations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model Predictive Control (MPC) relies on repeated model evaluations within an optimization loop.
 When using learned models,
 inference speed and mathematical structure are important to the feasibility and reliability of control,
 especially if real-time constraints need to be met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this end,
 two main requirements must be addressed.
 First,
 population-based optimization methods commonly employed in data-driven MPC,
 such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "de2005tutorial"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 require fast and batched predictions over large sets of candidate trajectories whose computational cost must remain predictable across control steps.
 Purely sequential inference with naive expert lookup in kCELL prohibitively expensive.
 Second,
 gradient-based optimization methods,
 such as Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rawlings2017model"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 require differentiable predictive models in order to compute local linearization of the dynamics and to handle hard constraints efficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kCELL must therefore comprise optimized implementations to enable fast batched inference and differentiable representations to support gradient-based control methods.
 Regarding computational efficiency,
 in kCELL,
 expert selection can be accelerated significantly through spatial indexing or parallel execution,
 enabling efficient batched inference on modern hardware such as GPUs.
 Regarding differentiability,
 when activation functions and internal models are differentiable,
 kCELL admits analytic gradients and straightforward local linearization,
 making it naturally compatible with gradient-based MPC formulations.

 These methods rely heavily on parallel evaluation of large population of candidate trajectories at each control step within the MPC framework.
 In this section,
 we show that GPU parallel brute force is more reliable than geospatial indexing for nearest neighbor selection to speed up learning and inference process in kCELL for population based MPC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Geospatial Tree Indexing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL instanciations like kCELL and oCELL,
 a learning step always begins with a neighboring agent selection phase.
 Since the agents are spatially distributed in the feature space,
 then the selection of neighboring agents can be broken down into two components:
 distance calculation to find the closest agents and thresholding of those distances to discriminate neighbors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because agents are spatially distributed within the feature space,
 managing the ensemble of agents as a geospatial database can be considered.
 In this case,
 to speed up nearest neighbor searches,
 spatial indexing techniques can be leveraged to select the k-closest agents with a reduced complexity.
 Indexing in geospatial databases is most commonly performances using tree-based methods such as KD-tree or R-tree

.
 Finally,
 with a spatial index based on a R-tree,
 the selection process can be broken down into three ordered steps:
 searching for the k-closest agents in the R-tree,
 calculating the distances between the point and the k-closest agents and  finally thresholding the distances to discriminate the neighbor agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing a R-tree as a geospatial index over the agents reduces the neighborhood searches from 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

 in the naive case to 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(\log n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 for insertion and deletion,
 the average time complexity increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 in the naive case to 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(\log n\right)$
\end_inset

 with geospatial indexing.
 While geospatial indexing seems less advantageous in terms of insertion and deletion,
 it should be remembered that agent creations and destructions are generally less frequent then neighborhood searches in kCELL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
GPU Parallelization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 as the dimensionality of the feature space increases,
 the structural advantages of the R-tree diminish due to distance distention and bounding box overlap making the search complexity degenerate to 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In such cases,
 the overhead induced by geospatial indexing offers no advantage over a brute-force approach.
 To address these limitations,
 the embarrassingly parallelizable nature of neighborhood search in kCELL (and oCELL) can be exploited through GPU acceleration.
 By shifting from pointer-based tree structures to dense tensor representations,
 kCELL (and oCELL) can leverage massive parallel throughput as the selection phase can be executed as a vectorized linear algebra operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Memory Layout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To maximize the efficiency of using the GPU for agent selection,
 agent data is stored in contiguous memory block.
 For example,
 for kCELL system,
 we define two global agent tensors for storing the parameters of the activation functions,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{T}_{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times n},\,\,\mathcal{T}_{\Sigma}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times n\times n}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the maximum agent capacity of the agent pool and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of features.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is for storing the means and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}_{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 is for storing the covariance matrices.
 With this layout,
 the GPU hardware can easily saturate its bandwith for efficient distance computations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Dynamic Agent Population
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL systems,
 the number of agents is dynamic.
 Agents can be created or destroyed depending on the needs of the system.
 In a GPU parallelization context with contiguous memory storage,
 managing a dynamic set of agents requires efficient creation and deletion strategies to avoid costly memory allocations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most straightforward approach consists in a dynamic reallocation of memory each time an agent is created or destroyed as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Although easy to implement,
 this approach is unsuitable for high-frequency learning loops due to the overhead induced by re-allocating GPU memory and copying of existing data.

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve

 updated complexity,
 another strategy can be considered.
 Fixed-capacity tensors are pre-allocated to store agents data.
 A boolean masking vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{N}$
\end_inset

 is maintained to track which memory slot contains an agent or not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agent creation then consists in assigning new agents data to the first index 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{i}=0$
\end_inset

.
 If the agent population exceeds the predefined capacity,
 standard dynamic resizing strategies can be employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely,
 agent deletion sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{i}=0$

 the competitive advantage of R-trees within the non linear phase transition area fades when the centroids are uniformly distributed.
 In this case the R-trees are almost never faster than GPU computation.
 It shows that the structure of data needs to be analyzed beforehand to make sure R-tree indexing is a pertinent indexing option.
 This is an expected result because R-trees are particularly adapted to prune large empty spaces.
 The uniform distribution of centroids does not exhibit exploitable structures for the R-tree.
 This is not an issue for the GPU based nearest neighbor computations that is a brute force approach that does not rely on structure.

\begin_layout Standard
These observations indicate that the performance of nearest neighbor selection with R-trees compared to using GPUs is better in low dimensional regimes (
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq5$
\end_inset

) and depends heavily on the underlying data structures when the number of dimensions increases (
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq5$
\end_inset

) due to the curse of dimensionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From an engineering standpoint,
 GPU-based selection provides a more predictable and stable latency profile,
 independent of data distribution.
 While R-tree indexing can provide large gains in very specific sparse regimes,
 its performance is highly sensitive to the latent structure of the learned model (i.e the distribution of agents).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an online learning setting for adaptive control in a MPC scheme without prior knowledge of the dynamics of the environment,
 the data distribution is not known in advance and may evolve over time.
 For this reason,
 the GPU-based brute-force selection is preferred for its 
\emph on

 and

.
 Indeed,
 GPU execution time scales predictably with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

,
 whereas R-tree latency exhibits high variance depending on tree depth and splits overlap.
 Moreover,
 GPUs naturally handles batch queries as a single high-throughput operation,
 which can be deemed useful for population-based optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation strategies discussed in this section address the primary computational bottleneck of kCELL for use in a MPC scheme,
 namely the repeated selection and evaluation of local experts under strict real-time constraints.
 By leveraging either spatial indexing or GPU brute force selection,
 kCELL can be integrated into population-based trajectory optimizers while maintaining predictable inference and learning latency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 computational efficiency alone is not sufficient for kCELL to be deployed with gradient-based optimizers that could potentially handle hard constraints.
 Such approaches require predictive models to admit local linearizations.

\begin_layout Standard
Fast and scalable inference in kCELL is essential for its integration into real-time MPC frameworks,
 especially when using population-based or gradient-based trajectory optimization methods that rely on repeated model evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However,
 computational efficiency alone is insufficient when MPC formulation rely on gradient-based optimization methods that exploit local structures to enforce hard constraints.
 Such approaches require predictive models that admit reliable local linearizations of the learned system dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section,
 we show that kCELL naturally provides local affine approximations of the dynamics that are directly compatible with gradient-based optimization approaches such as Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Differentiability in CELL instantiations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL instantiations,
 online learning is performed by maintaining a set of self-organizing spatialized agents that map the target function locally (cf Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Context-Ensemble-Local"

\end_inset

).
 A context agent is denoted as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{A}_{i}=\left\{ \phi_{i},f_{i}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\mapsto\left]0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 is an activation function that maps features to a level of expertise for predicting a given input and  
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\mapsto\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 is local internal prediction function that maps features to target outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CELL instantiations,
 the global prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions of agents,
 leveraging activation and prediction functions through an aggregation function.
 If the activation function,
 the prediction function and the aggregation function are differentiable,
 then,
 by standard composition rule,
 the global prediction function of the system is differentiable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For kCELL,
 we consider a RBF kernel as the activation function,
 an affine function as the prediction function and a weighted average as the aggregation function.
 The final prediction is obtained by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(x\right)=\frac{\sum_{i}\phi_{i}\left(x\right)f_{i}\left(x\right)}{\sum_{i}\phi_{i}\left(x\right)}=\sum_{i}w_{i}\left(x\right)f_{i}\left(x\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

 are the normalized weights such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}w_{i}\left(x\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As all the involved functions are differentiable with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
 the derivative of the prediction function of the system if given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\left(x\right)=\sum_{i}\left(\frac{\partial w_{i}}{\partial x}\left(x\right)f_{i}\left(x\right)+w_{i}\left(x\right)\frac{\partial f_{i}}{\partial x}\left(x\right)\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This property makes kCELL usable in gradient-based nonlinear optimization frameworks.
 However,
 we argue that a principled approach to linearization can be leveraged by exploiting kCELL's internal structure.
 In typical model-based control,
 non-linear dynamics are lienarized via a first-order Taylor expansion to fit the requirements of convex optimization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 However,
 when the predictive model is already an ensemble of local linear structures,
 applying a Taylor expansion becomes conceptually redundant.
 For this reason,
 we propose to bypass standard differentiation in favor of the structural local linearization capabilities of kCELL.

 Since both SQP and kCELL rely on locally valid approximations of the dynamics,
 the update step must be restricted to remain within the region where the linearization is accurate.

 This mechanism guarantees stable convergence when optimization trajectories with learned dynamics.
 The process is repeated until convergence.

provides exactly the matrices needed for the linearized dynamics in the QP.
 This way the approximated QP subproblem is fully compliant with the dynamics initially learned by the model,
 without having to build a proxy through differentiation and Taylor expansion.
 Consequently,
 SQP-based MPC provides a principled and efficient way to exploit kCELL's local structure while being able to enforce hard constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we discussed about the integration of kCELL into real-time MPC pipelines by exploiting both its computational and structural properties.
 First the differentiable and modular nature of kCELL enables highly parallel trajectory unfolding,
 making population-based optimizer tractable through GPU based implmentations.
 This approach is particularly adapted for large-scale trajectory sampling and global solution exploration.
 Then,
 we showed that kCELL's agent-based structure provides both differentiability and explicit local affine models of the learned dynamicsk for gradientt-based MPC.
 This property naturally allow the use of SQP,
 which exploits local linear models to efficiently enforce hard constraints and produce smooth control trajectories.
 Ultimately,
 we showed that using a kCELL predictive dynamics model,
 both population-based and gradient-based optimization schemes could be leveraged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond computational efficiency,
 kCELL exposes introspection signals such as distance-based competence and local model disagreement that quantify the reliability of the predictions along candidate trajectories.
 in the remainder of this chapter,
 we explore the use of these introspection signals to improve control in terms of exploration and exploitation under operational constraints.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integration of kCELL into SQP framework provides a solid and efficient way of exploiting current model knowledge.
 However,
 the performances of any model-based controller is bounded by the quality of the learned dynamics.
 In settings where no prior knowledge of the system is available,
 the controller must balance the minization of the task cost with the need to collect informative data in unknownn or poorly modeled regions of the state-action space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventional exploration methods typically depend on heuristic noise processes (e.g Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) or on uncertainty-based mechanisms derived from auxiliary models,

.
 While effective in many situations,
 these approaches quantify uncertainty through probabilistic inference or learned proxies that are determined by model design choices,
 whereas kCELL exposes uncertainty as a structural and geometric property of its spatialized local learning architecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kCELL's spatialized agent-based architecture provides two distinct introspection signals that can be directly embedded into the MPC objective function to drive exploration of unknown states:
 distance-based competence and local model disagreement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance-based competence quantifies how far a state-action pair lies from regions that are sufficiently covered by agents,
 providing a geometrical grounded measure of feature space epistemic uncertainty.
 Local model disagreement captures variability in the predicted dynamics across neighboring agents,
 yielding a local estimate of predictive uncertainty.
 Because kCELL operates in an online learning regime,
 these introspection quantities evolve through constant interaction with the environment and can be evaluated at every MPC iteration without retraining,
 posterior computations,
 or auxiliary optimization procedures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exploration can therefore be formulated as a deterministic,
 introspection-based regularization of the control objective,
 leading to the following augmented cost function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)=\alpha J_{\text{task}}\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)+\lambda J_{\text{explore}}\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\text{task}}$
\end_inset

 is the task-related cost function,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\text{explore}}$
\end_inset

 the exploration penalty and  
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in\mathbb{R},\,\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 the adjustment weights to trade-off task exploitation and exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distance-based Competence
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Distance-based-Competence"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike opaque black-box models,
 kCELL provides an explicit measure of its degree of knowledge about specific regions of the feature space through the spatial distribution of agents.
 To encourage exploration,
 the model must acquire data that lie outside the currently covered regions,
 i.e outside regions that have been sufficiently visited.
 The degree of knowledge associated with a state-action pair can be quantified by evaluating the Mahalanobis distance between the pair and the closest agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective is to deliberately drive the state-action trajectories away from the currently covered regions of the feature space to collect informative samples in poorly modeled areas.
 To achieve this,
 we introduce a distance-based penalty term 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{dist}}\left(x_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 that augments the MPC cost function by promoting exploration of unknown regions such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{\text{dist}}\left(x_{t}\right) & = & -\sum_{i\in D_{\text{closest}}}w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)\left(\left(x_{t}-\mu_{i}\right)^{\top}\Sigma_{i}^{-1}\left(x_{t}-\mu_{i}\right)\right)\\
 & = & -\sum_{i\in D_{\text{closest}}}w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)d\left(\mathcal{A}_{i},x_{t}\right)^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=\left[s_{t},u_{t}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\text{closest}}$
\end_inset

is the set of the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-closest agents,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the parameters of their activation function,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)=\frac{\phi_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)}{\sum_{j}\phi_{j}\left(x_{t}\right)}$
\end_inset

 are the weights depending on the activation of each agent on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the penalty is negative,
 minimizing the augmented MPC objective encourages trajectories that maximize the distance to the currently well-covered regions.
 in this context,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{dist}}\ll0$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is currently not supported by the agents' training data.
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{dist}}\approx0$
\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is close to a well-covered (known) region of feature space and is therefore likely to be already included in the current knowledge base.

Local Disagreement
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In regions where multiple agents are close in feature space,
 the variance between their individual predictions serves as a proxy for local predictive inconsistency.
 High disagreement suggests that the local dynamics are either stochastic,
 noisy or that the model has not yet converged to a stable local representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective is to drive the state-action trajectories towards regions exhibiting high predictive disagreement to force the model to discover new areas or to converge in already known region of feature space.
 This mechanism is functionally analogous to uncertainty-driven exploration strategies proposed in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this,
 we introduce a disagreement-based penalty term 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{disagree}}\left(x_{t}\right)$

This way,
 high energy states are harder to reach,
 making the exploration harder for uninformed random strategies.
 The cost function to minimize to solve the task is the following
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\min_{u_{0:T}}\sum_{t=0}^{T}\left(\left(s_{t}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)^{\top}Q\left(s_{t}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)+u_{t}^{\top}Ru_{t}\right)+\left(\left(s_{T+1}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)^{\top}Q\left(s_{T+1}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)\right)

with 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $R\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times1}$
\end_inset

 and  
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\text{ref}}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agent interacts with the environment for a total of 5000 time steps,
 divided into episodes of 500 steps.
 During interaction,
 a kCELL model is learned online from streaming data to predict the next state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trajectory optimization is performed using the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) because this approach is stochastic.
 Using a population-based optimizer naturally introduces variability in candidate action sequecnes.
 This stochasticity is important in the early learning phase of kCELL,
 as it avoids situations where newly created agents would be initialized with near-zero action variance,
 which can greatly hurt local model learning.
\end_layout

 The metrics measured in subsequent sections are averaged over 5 seeds to eliminate part of the stochastic bias induced by using stochastic optimizer and random exploration strategies.

 the continuous state space is discretized into a regular grid of bins (50 bins per dimension).

The results show that both introspection-driven strategies (distance-based competence and local disagreement) achieve significantly higher state-space coverage than the uninformed random uniform strategy under the same interaction budget:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx10\%$
\end_inset

 higher ratio for introspection-based strategies.
 Conversely,
 with pure exploitation strategy,
 where the controller optimizes only the task cost without any exploration regularization,
 results in the lowest coverage.
 This indicates that in the absence of prior knowledge of the dynamics,
 exploitation (i.e optimizing the task objective) alone is insufficient to drive the system toward diverse and informative regions of the state space.
\end_layout

Furthermore,
 The distance-based and disagreement-based strategies achieve comparable final coverage levels,
 indicating that both introspection signals are effective at promoting exploration beyond the regions initially supported by the data.

 The two introspection-driven strategies consistently dominate the random uniform baseline.

Both introspection-driven strategies show comparable growth in coverage over time.
 Minor differences in variability across seeds are observed but the mean coverage remains similar.
 This suggests that both strategies effectively promote exploration.
 Any apparent differences should be interpreted cautiously as they may not be statistically significant.

 these results confirm that embedding introspection signals directly into the MPC objective yields an exploration advantage over uninformed stochastic action sampling.

 For all strategies,
 states corresponding to low angular velocities and angles that are close to the starting configuration (

 reflecting the energy barrier associated with reaching high energy states associated with throwing the pendulum tip all the way to the top.

Clear differences emerge between strategies.
 Both distance-based and disagreement-based explorations achieve substantially broader coverage,
 with frequent visits to high-energy states corresponding to near-upright pendulum configurations (

 In contrast,

 Pure exploitation remains almost entirely confined near the starting state.
 It consistently fails to overcome the energy barrier required to explore the upper half of the state space.

 displays activations in the (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,\,\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

) space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the distance-based and disagreement-based strategises,
 agent activations cover the entire circular manifold corresponding to the pendulum's reachable positions,
 indicating that even high-energy and rarely visited states are locally modeled by dedicated agents.
 In contrast,
 with the random uniform and pure exploitation strategies,
 agent activations are concentrated in the lower-energy regions of the state space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A broader diversity in agent sizes can be observed for the introspection-driven strategies.
 This is most likely due to kCELL agent creation mechanism,
 which creates agents from a minimum number of samples to ensure thet local models are quickly reliable.
 In high-velocity regimes or during abrupt torque changes such as strong braking events,
 state transitions are more widely distributed,
 leading to larger initial covariance estimates.
 These larger agents are not pathological artifacts but instead reflect an specific experience of data,
 here corresponding to regions of high local variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example,
 in the (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,\,\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

) projection,
 some agents appear elongated along one dimension especially for the Distance-based strategy.
 Analysis of their covariance matrices reveals that these agents correspond to sharp directional changes in the dynamics,
 typically induced by large control intpus applied against the direction of motion.
 As such,
 agent geometry seems to provide an interpretable signature of local dynamical regimes encountered during exploration.
 The Distance-based strategy seeming to have more of these king of agents could be due to a more agressive exploration strategy that prioritizes more extreme action variations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These activation patterns demonstrate that kCELL does not cover the state space uniformly but organizes local models in a manner that reflects the underlying geometry and variability of the dynamics encountered during exploration.

Prediction Accuracy and Sample Efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess whether introspection-driven exploration strategies translate into better models,
 we evaluate the predictive accuracy of kCELL after the exploration phase.
 For each exploration strategy,
 the learned model is evaluated on an exhaustive test set crafted specifically to cover a large portion of the state-action space.
 Model performance is quantified using the root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted and ground-truth next states.

 presents a bar plot that reports the average RMSE across five seeds for the four exploration strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both introspection-driven strategies achieve substantially lower prediction error than the random uniform and pure exploitation baselines.
 In contrast,
 no statistically significant difference in RMSE is observed between the distance-based and disagreement-based strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results indicate that introspection-driven exploration improves the sample efficiency of online model learning in kCELL.
 While the two introspection signals lead to slightly different exploration dynamics,
 they results in comparable models in terms of predictive quality under the same interaction budget.
 This suggests that the shallow performance differences observed in state-space coverage are not likely associated with systematic differences in model accuracy under the considered interaction budget and evaluation protocol.

Global Action Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although distance-based and disagreement-based strategies yield comparable coverage and predictive accuracy,
 minor differences in exploration dynamics were observed in coverage variability and in agent population statistics across seeds.
 Those variations are subtle and may reflect stochastic effects of the optimizer rather than systematic differences.
 To investigate the general behavior of the controller under introspection-driven exploration objectives,
 we analyzed the distribution of actions taken during exploration.

 presents kernel density estimates of the applied control inputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting action distributions are very similar for both introspection-driven strategies.
 Three dominant modes can be observed centered around saturated control actions (-2,
 2) and near-zero actions.
 This multimodal structure contrasts with the random uniform baseline.
 It indicates that both introspection-driven strategies induce structured non-uniform action profiles.
 The presence of repeated extreme actions suggests that introspection-driven objectives actively promote saturated actions in order to reach higher energy states rather than relying on diffuse stochastic perturbations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results suggest that the observed similarities in coverage and model accuracy are more likely attributable to how these signals interact with local geometry and agent creation rather than fundamentally different global action sampling behaviors.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental results presented in this section demonstrate that introspection-driven exploration strategies based on kCELL online modeling improve exploration efficiency in model-based control settings without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
 By embedding distance-based competence and local model disagreement directly into the MPC objective,
 the controller is able to consistently escape well-modeled regions and acquire informative data in unknown regions of the state-action space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coverage metrics and spatial visualizations show that both introspection-driven strategies lead to a better coverage than uninformed random uniform exploration and pure exploitation.
 Introspection-driven strategies are able to overcome the energy barrier induced by the pendulum environment.
 High energy configurations are repeatedly visited despite being hard to reach for uninformed strategies.
 These results confirm that effective exploration cannot be achieved through randomly uniform actions alone,
 but instead requires additional motivations like model knowledge or uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of global action distributions confirms that both introspection-driven strategies induce structured multimodal action profiles that facilitate exploration of high-energy states.
 The similarities observed in these distributions suggest that the two strategies behave comparably interms of global action patterns.
 Differences in coverage or agent population arise primarily from interactions with local agent geometry rather than fundamentally different action sampling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the agent level,
 activation patterns and population dynamics provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of introspection-driven exploration strategies.
 Increased agent creation correlates strongly with improved coverage.
 This indicates that exploration emerges from the interaction between the introspection objective and kCELL's agent creation process.
 Furthermore,
 agent geometry and size variability reflect local properties of the dynamics.
 For example,
 for high-velocity regimes,
 created agents tend to be larger or for sharp directional changes,
 agents displays a high variance on the action dimension.
 Each agent represents a singular experience of data.
 This highlights one of the key advantage of kCELL,
 which is its interpretability.
 Indeed,
 uncertainty and model structure are not hidden within opaque parameters but instead manifest explicitly through the spatial organization of agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the observed improvements in predictive accuracy confirm that introspection-driven exploration translates into concrete benefits for online model learning.
 Under a fixed interaction budget,
 broader and more structured exploration leads to more accurate learning dynamics.
 It reinforces the link between exploration strategy,
 model quality and downstream control performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 kCELL's architecture allows to extract introspection signals that can be leveraged successfully to build efficient uncertainty-aware exploration mechanisms without prior knowledge about the dynamics of the environment.
 Those mechanisms do not rely on external stochastic processes or auxiliary uncertainty models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the results demonstrate the effectiveness of introspection-driven exploration with kCELL,
 several limitations still stand and need to be acknowledged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kCELL was introduced to address the overoptimistic spatial representations of oCELL (cf.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Limitations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

) that originated from the use of orthotope based spatialization.
 While allowing more degrees of freedom and a better representative power,
 using Gaussian-based spatialization introduces its own set of constraints.
 Agents are spatialized using RBF kernels parameterized by the mean and covariance estimated from local ingested data.
 As a result,
 agent creation requires a minimum diversity level to avoid ill-conditioned covariance estimates.
 In practice,
 this makes early exploration phases or low-variability action regimes potentially problematic.
 On the other hand,
 while population-based optimizers such as CEM introduce stochasticity that partially mitigates this issue by inducing action variability,
 excessive dispersion of actions can lead to overly extended agents and interpolation errors.
 This effect can be observed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Activation-Patterns-AngleAngularVelocity-Pendulum"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 through some agents that appear elongated (especially for distance-based strategy) due to too spread out actions.
 These agents still represent valid local experiences but such behavior may pose challenges when extending the approach to more complex control environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian assumption underlying agent spatialization restricts the ability of kCELL to faithfully represent complex or multimodal feature manifolds that cannot be represented by a single Gaussian kernel.
 The agent population can approximate such structures through multiple overlapping agents,
 but this approximation remains indirect.
 Extending the spatialization mechanism beyond Gaussian assumptions,
 for example by using kernel density estimates or mixture-based representations,
 could allow kCELL to better capture complex feature geometries.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental evaluation is restricted to a low-dimensional control problem (3 state dimensions and 1 action dimension).
 The pendulum environment captures nontrivial exploration challenges such as energy barriers.
 However,
 scalability to higher-dimensional systems remains an open question for kCELL.
 In such settings,
 agent management,
 coverage estimation and computational overhead may require additional mechanisms such as dimensionality reduction (which we explore in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Scalable-Non-Linear-CELL"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 this study considers distance-based competence and local disagreement as independent exploration objectives.
 A combined approach was not explored,
 primarily because thses introspection signals operate on very different scales and have distinct geometrical interpretations.
 Investigating principled combinations or adaptive weighting schemes between distance-based and disagreement-based objectives could reveal complementary effects and lead to more exhaustive exploration strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond exploration,
 introspection signals extracted from kCELL naturally lead to the design of conservative control strategies under learned dynamics.
 While exploring exploits these signals to deliberately seek poorly modeled regions,
 the same quantities can be repurposed during exploitation to bias the controller toward states where the model is locally reliable.
 In this setting,
 introspection costs no longer acts as penalties but as a confidence-aware bonuses that encourage trajectoires to remain close to existing agents,
 i.e close to the current knwoledge of the model.

 to quantify the prediction uncertainty and take it into account in optimization to obtain safe conservative control policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
kCELL's spatialized agent-based architecture provides valuable introspection signals that can serve as proxies for epistemic uncertainty.
 Those introspection signals can be directly embedded into the MPC objective to regularize the behavior of the resulting policy by keeping the explored states at optimization time into the knowledge landscape of the model,
 avoiding wandering into unknown states that would induce large error compounding effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we focus specifically on distance-based competence introspection signals that quantify how far a state lies from regions that are sufficiently covered by agents.
 It provides a geometrically grounded measure of epistemic uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To bias the policy toward a more conservative knowledge-aware regime,
 an introspection-based regularization of the control objective is defined,
 leading to the following augmented cost function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)=\alpha J_{\text{task}}\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)+\lambda J_{\text{conservative}}\left(s_{t},u_{t}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\text{task}}$
\end_inset

 is the task-related cost function,
 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\text{conservative}}$
\end_inset

 the conservative regularization term and  
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in\mathbb{R},\,\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 the adjustment weights to trade-off task exploitation and conservatism.
 In this context we define a conservative policy,
 as a policy that is biased toward minimizing epistemic uncertainty.

Distance-based Conservatism

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike opaque black-box models,
 kCELL provides an explicit measure of its degree of knowledge about specific regions of the feature space through the spatial distribution of agents.
 To encourage conservatism,
 the controller must keep evaluated solutions and state trajectories close to the covered regions of the feature space.
 In kCELL,
 the degree of knowledge associated with an input 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 can be quantified by evaluating the Mahalanobis distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the closest agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In kCELL one of the structural hypothesis is that agents are local experts on the function to approximate and that the closer an input is to the center of an agent,
 the most probable the prediction will be accurate.
 Thus,
 the objective is to deliberately drive the trajectories close to the currently covered regions,
 that is to say,
 closer to the center of agents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this,
 we introduce a distance-based regularization term 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\text{dist}}\left(x_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 that augments the MPC cost function by promoting conservative behaviors such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
q_{\text{dist}}\left(x_{t}\right) & = & \sum_{i\in D_{\text{closest}}}w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)\left(\left(x_{t}-\mu_{i}\right)^{\top}\Sigma_{i}^{-1}\left(x_{t}-\mu_{i}\right)\right)\\
 & = & \sum_{i\in D_{\text{closest}}}w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)d\left(\mathcal{A}_{i},x_{t}\right)^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=\left[s_{t},u_{t}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\text{closest}}$
\end_inset

is the set of the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-closest agents,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the parameters of their activation function,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)=\frac{\phi_{i}\left(x_{t}\right)}{\sum_{j}\phi_{j}\left(x_{t}\right)}$
\end_inset

 are the weights depending on the activation of each agent on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the penalty is positive,
 minimizing the augmented MPC objective encourages trajectories that minimize the distance to the currently well-covered regions (in constrast to what is done for exploration in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in this context,
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\text{dist}}\gg0$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is currently not supported by the agents' training data.
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\text{dist}}\approx0$
\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is close to a well-covered (known) region of feature space and is therefore likely to have been encountered during training.
 As

 it can easily be embedded for optimization with fast conic solvers like OSQP

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment evaluates the impact of introspection-driven conservative regularization on the reliability of trajectory optimization using a kCELL learned dynamics model within a MPC scheme.
 The objective is to assess whether considering the spatialization of agents of a kCELL model during optimization reduces extrapolation errors and improves robustness of long-horizon predictions.
\end_layout

 which exhibits nonlinear dynamics.
 States are composed of the 
\begin_inset Formula $x,\,y$
\end_inset

 2D-coordinates of the tip of the pendulum and of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}$
\end_inset

 the angular velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A kCELL model is learned online from streaming interaction data.
 The population of linear agent predictors is spatialized in the state space (not including actions).
 This design choice is motivated by empirical observations on the pendulum task.
 Indeed,
 spatializing agents jointly over state and action dimensions leads to slower stabilization of agent population,
 whereas state-only spatialization resulted in faster convergence of local models and more stable agent coverage.
 Given the low-dimensional action space and the smooth dynamics,
 state-based spatialization provides a favorable tradeoff between model predictive accuracy and sample efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure a sufficient coverage of the state space,
 an informed finetuned stochastic exploration policy based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise is used to interact with the simulation environment to collect learning data.
 This exploration phase to build a kCELL model is conducted for a fixed interaction budget of 30k steps.
 The learned dynamics model is frozen and used subsequently for evaluation.
 No further learning occurs during evaluation,
 ensuring that observed effects are attributable to the optimization strategy rather than continued model adaptation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Control actions are obtained using a MPC scheme.
 Action sequences are optimized over a finite horizon using the learned kCELL dynamics.
 Trajectory optimization is performed using SQP with OSQP conic solver to solve the local Quadratic Programs at each iteration.
 Using SQP,
 a gradient-based optimizer,
 allows to isolate the effect of the proposed regularization without introducing stochastic variability which is inherent to population-based optimization methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The baseline optimization objective,
 i.e the cost function to minimize to solve the task is the following
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\min_{u_{0:T}}\sum_{t=0}^{T}\left(\left(s_{t}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)^{\top}Q\left(s_{t}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)+u_{t}^{\top}Ru_{t}\right)+\left(\left(s_{T+1}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)^{\top}Q\left(s_{T+1}-s_{\text{ref}}\right)\right)

\end_inset

 and  
\begin_inset Formula $s_{\text{ref}}$
\end_inset

 the target state to reach for the pendulum which usually is the top neutral position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To this objective,
 an additional conservative regularization term 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\text{dist}}$
\end_inset

 is introduced (cf Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Distance-based-Conservatism"
plural "false"
caps "false"

nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 This regularization term is weighted by a coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\geq0$
\end_inset

,
 penalizing predicted trajectories that run accross low coverage regions of the state space,
 envouraging solutions that remain within areas well covered by the agent.
 The goal is to stay close to what the model knows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evaluation is conducted for multiple values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 We refer to the unregularized case 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 as the baseline.
 To evaluate robustness and reliability independently of exploration stochasticity,
 control performance is assessed from an exhaustive set of initial states sampled over a grid in the state space.
 For each initial state,
 the predictions produced by kCELL with the found solution are compared against the ground-truth trajectory.
 This allows direct measurement of prediction error against the true dynamics,
 also allowing to assess the compounding effects on a given horizon.
 All evaluations are performed using identical MPC horizons (
\begin_inset Formula $T=20$

),
 cost function,
 solver parameters and constraints across regularization settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validation of Regularization Behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To validate the behavior of the regularization term,
 we measure the mean agent activation along optimized trajectories.
 Activation of agents serves as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty by measuring the distance to the closest experts in state space.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents boxplots of the mean agent activation for each considered values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 increases,
 we observe a clear increase in mean agent activation indicating that the optimizer progressively favors trajectories that remain closer to the centers of kCELL agents,
 i.e within regions that are well supported by training data.
 This behavior is consistent with the expected behavior of the regularization term 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\text{dist}}$
\end_inset

.
 The optimization landscape is effectively reshaped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to that,
 increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 also yields a noticeable reduction in the spread of the activation distributions across initial conditions.
 This reduced variability indicates that under stronger regularization trajectories initialized in different regions are increasingly constrained to remain within similarly well-supported regions.
 This effect suggests that the regularization not only increases overall conservatism but also homogenizes the level of model support encountered along optimized trajectories.

These results validate the behavior of the introspection-driven regularization mechanism.
 The regularizer acts as intended by increasing the proximity of optimized trajectories to kCELL agent centers and reduces variability in model competence across initial conditions.

 For each value of regularization coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

,
 along each optimized rollout,
 the predicted state transitions produced by kCELL are compared against ground-truth trajectories.
 Prediction error is computed and aggregated over the horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the regularization coefficient increases,
 a downward shift of the error distributions can be observed.
 Higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 correspond to lower median and mean prediction errors indicating that trajectories optimized under strong regularization are predicted more accurately on average by the learned model.
 This behavior is consistent with the core hypothesis of kCELL that stipulates that regions of high agent activation correspond to areas where local linear models provide the most reliable approximations of the true dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This reduction in prediction error does not arise from any modification of the learned kCELL model itself which remains fixed during evaluation.
 Instead,
 it is a direct consequent of the optimizer preferentially selecting trajectories that remain within regions of the state space that are well supported by training data.
 Thus,
 the regularization acts as a mechanism for smarter model usage rather than model improvement.
 By penalizing trajectories that lie too much in lowly covered regions,
 the optimizer performs a form of constrained optimization where the constraint is the validity of the local linear approximation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to that,
 the downward shift in mean absolute error distributions for increasing values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is accompanied to a decrease in the spread of the error distributions.
 This indicates that large mean prediction errors become progressively less frequent as regularization strength increases.
 This suggests that distance-based regularization not only improves average prediction accuracy but also reduces the occurence of extreme prediction failures across considered initial conditions.
 This effect is particularly relevant in terms of reliability of the model as it seems to successfully prevent to some extent,
 the controller to exploit faulty out of distribution trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these results confirm that the spatial organization of agents in a kCELL model encodes meaningful information about local model reliability.
 This information can be effectively exploited during trajectory optimization.
 By encouraging trajectories to remain within regions of high agent coverage,
 the proposed regularization yields more accurate and more consistent predictions.
 This way it improves the reliability of model-based control with learned dynamics.

Impact on Compounding Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main limitations of learned dynamics models in model-based control is their susceptibility to error accumulation over long prediction horizons.
 Even small local inaccuracies can compound across successive rollout steps rapidly degrading the prediction quality and optimization results in the process.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of regularization,
 for the baseline,
 the prediction error increases rapidly with the horizon length reflecting the compounding effects of model errors in multi-step rollouts.
 This behavior highlights represents a challenge in standard MPC schemes based on learned dynamics models when operating with out of distribution data

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 values increase,
 the rate at which prediction error grows with the horizon steps is substantially reduced.
 Stronger regularization leads to consistently lower prediction errors especially for more distant horizon steps.
 This confirms that the primary benefit of the proposed regularization lies in mitigating compounding errors rather than improving one-step prediction accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these results show that this introspection-based regularization term improves the reliability of long-horizon predictions in MPC.
 By maintaining the trajectory within highly covered regions,
 the error propagation is dampened,
 preventing the exponential divergence typically observed in the unregularized case over the horizon.
 It reduces the myopic behavior induced by error-prone rollouts and enhances the practical usability of kCELL learned dynamics models for more reliable control policies.

 As

 the mean cumulative cost slightly increases compared to the unregularized baseline (

 This indicates that the controller increasingly sacrifices task optimality in order to remain within regions of the state space that are well supported by the learned kCELL model.
 In addition to that,
 the spread of the cost distributions decreases with stronger regularization.
 This suggests that conservative behavior leads to more uniform,
 less optimal,
 performances across initial conditions.

 trajectories associated with lower prediction errors tend to incur higher costs.

 followed by a more gradual regime.

Overall,
 for this specific control task,

 Stronger regularization improves prediction accuracy and reduces error accumulation at the expense of control optimality.

 Further works on different control tasks should be carried on to find a practical tuning mechanism for the conservative coefficient.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment shows that the spatial organization of agents in kCELL can be directly exploited during trajectory optimization to improve the reliability of model-based control with a learned kCELL model.
 A distance-based regularization term derived from agent coverage is embedded into the MPC objective and it effectively bias the optimizer toward regions of the state space where the learned dynamics are supported by training data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that this regularization method leads to trajectories that remain closer to agent centers,
 reduced prediction errors and attenuated error compounding over horizon steps.
 These effects are observed without modifying the learned kCELL model.
 The improvement arises solely from how the model is exploited by the optimizer,
 rather than from improved accuracy that would be obtained by continuous learning.
 The proposed regularization mechanism does not attempt to make the model more accurate.
 Instead,
 it exploits epistemic awareness to make the better off of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover,
 these results provide empirical support for the local expertise hypothesis that represents the core of kCELL.
 A correlation between activation of agents and reduced prediction error can be observed.
 It validates the assumption that local linear models are more and more reliable the closest the features are to their center.
 The regularization mechanism transforms this hypothesis into a control-relevant advanatage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By increasing the regularization coefficient,
 the reduction in the growth rate of prediction error across the horizon steps improves largely the longer the horizon.
 In this case,
 it seems that the main effect of this introspection-based regularization approach lies in mitigatin erorr compounding effects.
 The regularization term prevents the optimizer from relying too much on aggressive extrapolated trajectories.
 This way,
 the controller looks to avoid MPC instabilities that arise from inaccurate predictions and misguided optimization.
 The pendulum environment is forgiving,
 because due to inertia,
 an unregularized MPC controller can recover from mistakes.
 However,
 in more complex control environments with less smooth dynamics this might not be the case and a regularization strategy could prove useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time,
 theresults show a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and task performance in term of cumulated costs.
 Increasing conservatism leads to higher cumulative costs and lower predictive error.
 This behavior is expected and results directly from enforcing knowledge-aware regularization to the controller.
 The regularization acts as a soft feasibility constraint on the validity of the model,
 considering that unknown regions are somewhat unfeasible or dangerous.
 This is similar to trust-region methods in nonlinear optimization

 showed that this tradeoff seems nonlinear.
 Reductions in prediction error can be obtained for relatively small increases in cost,
 suggesting that intermediate regularization strengths may offer a practical compromise between safety and performance.
 This observation is relevant for real-world applications where safety is required.
 In these cases,
 slight suboptimality is acceptable in exchange for improve reliability and reduced risk of catastrophic failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 this study shows that kCELL's interpretability properties can be embedded into optimization pipelines.
 The proposed regularization mechanism consistures a principle way to translate structural transparency into conservative control behavior.
 This approach is a little step further towards reliable (i.e safe) model-based control based on learned dynamics models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparative study that we conducted as well as the proposed introspection-based regularization mechanism exhibit some limitations that should be acknowledged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presented experiments,
 proximity to agent centers correlates well with prediction accuracy.
 However,
 the distance-based competence measure used in this study is only a proxy for epistemic uncertainty.
 It is not a calibrated uncertainty estimate.
 As such,
 this regularization approach should be interpreted as a heuristic for risk reduction rather than a formal safety guarantee.
 Its effectiveness deeply depends on the structure and distribution of agents.
 No guarantees can be provided at the moment if the agent coverage is insufficient or poorly aligned with the true dynamics of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment has been conducted on a low-dimensional dynamical system (the pendulum) with smooth dynamics.
 As pointed out in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:kCELL-Discussions-and-Limitations"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 in low dimensional case,
 Mahalanobis distances (that are used for regularization) are not too distorted and remain meaningful.
 In higher dimensional cases the agent coverage might become more sparse.
 The impact of dimensionality on the effectiveness of the proposed regularization has not been studied in this chapter and remains an important limitation.
 This regularization approach might require additional mechanisms to remain effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We made the choice of spatializing agents only in the state space for convenience reasons to stabilize faster the agent population at learning time.
 This choice limits expressiveness of agents regarding actions.
 While this design choice is appropriate for the pendulum control task,
 it may not generalize to other dynamical systems.
 In such cases,
 regularization in joint state-action space could be required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another limitation relates to the density and sparsity of agent population.
 The conducted experiment rely on a single learned kCELL model trained with a fixed exploration budget.
 The effect of the sparsity of agent population on the conservative regularization behavior has not beed studied.
 Training multiple models with varying agent densities would be necessary to better characterize how coverage quality impacts the reliability gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we show that it might be possible to find a value for the regularization coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 that could represent a satisfying tradeoff between performance loss and increased predictive accuracy.
 However,
 we do not provide a principled way to tune the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 regularization coefficient.
 It must be done manually depending on the task nature and on the scale of task cost.
 Further investigations across different control environments are needed to extract practical insights and rules to chose the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 depending on the problem characteristics as well as performance and predictive accuracy requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the proposed approach improves the reliability of the controller but does not ensure safety.
 The regularization reduces the likelihood of failure due to prediction errors by discouraging extrapolation but it does not prevent it entirely.

Indeed,
 when the number of features increases,
 it is much rarer for an agent to be considered a neighbor of a new point.
 Therefore,
 the amoung of data required for training is much greater and  the number of agents created grows rapidly.
 Thus,
 we identify a need to limit the growth in the number of agents to increase sample efficiency and limit redundancy in the knowledge base.

Speed Recommendation:
 Industrial Use Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The enforcement of the EU General Safety Regulation has accelerated the adoption of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) systems in new vehicles,
 emphasizing the need for reliable embedded speed recommendations.
 Unlike classical speed control approaches that are centered on vehicle dynamics modeling,
 speed recommendation requires reasoning that considers the driver in the loop,
 introducing behavioral variability and acceptance constraints.
 Designing deployable systems further demands attention to safety compliance,
 homologation requirements,
 robustness under sensor failure and potential impacts on energy consumption.
 In this chapter,
 we discuss these challenges and outline design principles for building speed recommendation systems suitable for real-world deployment and propose search directions to advance the field toward operational intelligent speed recommendation solutions.
